2 at

4 some

1 a

4 then
2 if

2 is
1 a

1 a
3 day
3 and
2 at

2 an
4 hour
3 but
1 i
4 take
2 it
4 that
2 it
2 is
4 more
6 likely
2 to
2 be
4 some
5 crony
2 of
3 the
8 landlady
1 s
8 sherlock
6 holmes
3 was
5 wrong
2 in
3 his
10 conjecture
7 however
3 for
5 there
4 came
1 a
4 step
2 in
3 the
7 passage
3 and
1 a
7 tapping
2 at
3 the
4 door
2 he
9 stretched
3 out
3 his

3 arm
2 to
4 turn

6 looked
5 about

9 anxiously
2 in
3 the
5 glare
2 of
3 the
4 lamp
3 and
1 i
5 could
3 see
4 that
3 his
4 face
3 was
4 pale
3 and
3 his
4 eyes
5 heavy
4 like
5 those
2 of

1 i
8 question
3 sir

2 in
3 all
4 your
10 experience
3 you
4 have
4 ever
8 listened
2 to
1 a
4 more
10 mysterious
3 and
12 inexplicable
5 chain
2 of
6 events
4 than
5 those
5 which
4 have
8 happened
2 in
2 my
3 own
6 family
3 you
4 fill
2 me
4 with
8 interest

8 question
3 you
2 as
2 to
5 those
7 details
5 which
4 seem
2 to
2 me
2 to
2 be
4 most
9 important
3 the
5 young
3 man
6 pulled
3 his

2 up

6 pushed
3 his
3 wet
4 feet
3 out
7 towards
3 the
5 blaze
2 my
4 name

2 as
3 far
2 as
1 i
3 can
10 understand
6 little
2 to
2 do
4 with
4 this
5 awful
8 business
2 it
2 is
1 a
10 hereditary
6 matter
2 so
2 in
5 order
2 to
4 give
3 you
2 an
4 idea
2 of
3 the

1 i
4 must
2 go
4 back
2 to
3 the
12 commencement
2 of
3 the
6 affair
3 you
4 must
4 know
4 that
2 my

3 had
3 two

5 elias
3 and
2 my
6 father
6 joseph
2 my

5 which
2 he
8 enlarged
2 at
3 the
4 time
2 of
3 the
9 invention
2 of
9 bicycling
2 he
3 was
1 a
8 patentee
2 of
3 the
8 openshaw
11 unbreakable
4 tire
3 and
3 his
8 business
3 met
4 with
4 such
7 success
4 that
2 he
3 was
4 able
2 to
4 sell
2 it
3 and
2 to
6 retire
4 upon
1 a
8 handsome
10 competence
2 my
5 uncle
5 elias
9 emigrated
2 to
7 america
4 when
2 he
3 was
1 a
5 young
3 man
3 and
6 became
1 a
7 planter
2 in
7 florida
5 where
2 he
3 was
8 reported
2 to
4 have
4 done
4 very
4 well
2 at
3 the
4 time
2 of
3 the
3 war
2 he
6 fought
2 in
7 jackson
1 s
4 army
3 and
10 afterwards
5 under
4 hood
5 where
2 he
4 rose
2 to
2 be
1 a
7 colonel
4 when
3 lee
4 laid
4 down
3 his
4 arms
2 my
5 uncle
8 returned
2 to
3 his
10 plantation
5 where
2 he
8 remained
3 for
5 three
2 or
4 four
5 years
5 about
2 or
2 he
4 came
4 back
2 to
6 europe
3 and
4 took
1 a
5 small
6 estate
2 in
6 sussex
4 near
7 horsham
2 he
3 had
4 made
1 a
4 very
12 considerable
7 fortune
2 in
3 the
6 states
3 and
3 his
6 reason
3 for
7 leaving
4 them
3 was
3 his
8 aversion
2 to
3 the
7 negroes
3 and
3 his
7 dislike
2 of
3 the
10 republican
6 policy
2 in
9 extending
3 the
9 franchise
2 to
4 them
2 he
3 was
1 a
8 singular
3 man
6 fierce
3 and
5 quick
8 tempered
4 very
4 foul
7 mouthed
4 when
2 he
3 was
5 angry
3 and
2 of
1 a
4 most
8 retiring
11 disposition
6 during
3 all
3 the
5 years
4 that
2 he
5 lived
2 at
7 horsham
1 i
5 doubt
2 if
4 ever
2 he
3 set
4 foot
2 in
3 the
4 town
2 he
3 had
1 a
6 garden
3 and
3 two
2 or
5 three
6 fields
5 round
3 his
5 house
3 and
5 there
2 he
5 would
4 take
3 his
8 exercise
6 though
4 very
5 often
3 for
5 weeks
2 on
3 end
2 he
5 would
5 never
5 leave
3 his
4 room
2 he
5 drank
1 a
5 great
4 deal
2 of
6 brandy
3 and
6 smoked
4 very
7 heavily
3 but
2 he
5 would
3 see
2 no
7 society
3 and
3 did
3 not
4 want
3 any
7 friends
3 not
4 even
3 his
3 own
7 brother
2 he
4 didn
1 t
4 mind
2 me
2 in
4 fact
2 he
4 took
1 a
5 fancy
2 to
2 me
3 for
2 at
3 the
4 time
4 when
2 he
3 saw
2 me
5 first
1 i
3 was
1 a
9 youngster
2 of
6 twelve
2 or
2 so
4 this
5 would
2 be
2 in
3 the
4 year
5 after
2 he
3 had
4 been
5 eight
2 or
4 nine
5 years
2 in
7 england
2 he
6 begged
2 my
6 father
2 to
3 let
2 me
4 live
4 with
3 him
3 and
2 he
3 was
4 very
4 kind
2 to
2 me
2 in
3 his
3 way
4 when
2 he
3 was
5 sober
2 he
4 used
2 to
2 be
4 fond
2 of
7 playing
10 backgammon
3 and
8 draughts
4 with
2 me
3 and
2 he
5 would
4 make
2 me
3 his
14 representative
4 both
4 with
3 the
8 servants
3 and
4 with
3 the
12 tradespeople
2 so
4 that
2 by
3 the
4 time
4 that
1 i
3 was
7 sixteen
1 i
3 was
5 quite
6 master
2 of
3 the
5 house
1 i
4 kept
3 all
3 the
4 keys
3 and
5 could
2 go
5 where
1 i
5 liked
3 and
2 do
4 what
1 i
5 liked
2 so
4 long
2 as
1 i
3 did
3 not
7 disturb
3 him
2 in
3 his
7 privacy
5 there
3 was
3 one
8 singular
9 exception
7 however
3 for
2 he
3 had
1 a
6 single
4 room
1 a
6 lumber
4 room
2 up
5 among
3 the
6 attics
5 which
3 was
10 invariably
6 locked
3 and
5 which
2 he
5 would
5 never
6 permit
6 either
2 me
2 or
6 anyone
4 else

3 the
4 room
3 the
4 fire
3 was
7 burning
8 brightly
3 and
2 in

1 a
4 mass
2 of
5 black
6 fluffy
5 ashes
2 as
2 of
6 burned
5 paper
5 while
3 the
5 brass

6 signed
3 the
5 paper
2 as
8 directed
3 and
3 the
6 lawyer
4 took
2 it
4 away
4 with
3 him
3 the
8 singular
8 incident
4 made
2 as
3 you
3 may
5 think
3 the
7 deepest
10 impression
4 upon
2 me
3 and
1 i
8 pondered
4 over
2 it
3 and
6 turned
2 it
5 every
3 way
2 in
2 my
4 mind
7 without
5 being
4 able
2 to
4 make
8 anything
2 of
2 it
3 yet
1 i
5 could
3 not
5 shake
3 off
3 the
5 vague
7 feeling
2 of
5 dread
5 which
2 it
4 left
6 behind
6 though
3 the
9 sensation
4 grew
4 less
4 keen
2 as
3 the
5 weeks
6 passed
3 and
7 nothing
8 happened
2 to
7 disturb
3 the
5 usual
7 routine
2 of
3 our
5 lives
1 i
5 could
3 see
1 a
6 change
2 in
2 my
5 uncle
7 however
2 he
5 drank
4 more
4 than
4 ever
3 and
2 he
3 was
4 less
8 inclined
3 for
3 any
4 sort
2 of
7 society
4 most
2 of
3 his
4 time
2 he
5 would
5 spend
2 in
3 his
4 room
4 with
3 the
4 door
6 locked
4 upon
3 the
6 inside
3 but
9 sometimes
2 he
5 would
6 emerge
2 in
1 a
4 sort
2 of
7 drunken
6 frenzy
3 and
5 would
5 burst
3 out
2 of
3 the
5 house
3 and
4 tear
5 about
3 the
6 garden
4 with
1 a
8 revolver
2 in
3 his
4 hand
9 screaming
3 out
4 that
2 he
3 was
6 afraid
2 of
2 no
3 man
3 and
4 that
2 he
3 was
3 not
2 to
2 be
6 cooped
2 up
4 like
1 a
5 sheep
2 in
1 a
3 pen
2 by
3 man
2 or
5 devil
4 when
5 these
3 hot
4 fits
4 were
4 over
7 however
2 he
5 would
4 rush
12 tumultuously
2 in
2 at
3 the
4 door
3 and
4 lock
3 and
3 bar
2 it
6 behind
3 him
4 like
1 a
3 man
3 who
3 can
6 brazen
2 it
3 out
2 no
6 longer
7 against
3 the
6 terror
5 which
4 lies
2 at
3 the
5 roots
2 of
3 his
4 soul
2 at
4 such
5 times
1 i
4 have
4 seen
3 his
4 face
4 even
2 on
1 a
4 cold
3 day
7 glisten
4 with
8 moisture
2 as
6 though
2 it
4 were
3 new
6 raised
4 from
1 a
5 basin
4 well
2 to
4 come
2 to
2 an
3 end
2 of
3 the
6 matter
2 mr
6 holmes
3 and
3 not
2 to
5 abuse
4 your
8 patience
5 there
4 came
1 a
5 night
4 when
2 he
4 made
3 one
2 of
5 those
7 drunken
7 sallies
4 from
5 which
2 he
5 never
4 came
4 back
2 we
5 found
3 him
4 when
2 we
4 went
2 to
6 search
3 for
3 him
4 face
8 downward
2 in
1 a
6 little
5 green
7 scummed
4 pool
5 which
3 lay
2 at
3 the
4 foot
2 of
3 the
6 garden
5 there
3 was
2 no
4 sign
2 of
3 any
8 violence
3 and
3 the
5 water
3 was
3 but
3 two
4 feet
4 deep
2 so
4 that
3 the
4 jury
6 having
6 regard
2 to
3 his
5 known
12 eccentricity
7 brought
2 in
1 a
7 verdict
2 of
7 suicide
3 but
1 i
3 who
4 knew
3 how
2 he
6 winced
4 from
3 the
4 very
7 thought
2 of
5 death
3 had
4 much
3 ado
2 to
8 persuade
6 myself
4 that
2 he
3 had
4 gone
3 out
2 of
3 his
3 way
2 to
4 meet
2 it
3 the
6 matter
6 passed
7 however

4 made
1 a
7 careful
11 examination
2 of
3 the
5 attic
5 which
3 had
4 been
6 always
6 locked
2 up
2 we

8 contents
3 had
4 been
9 destroyed

9 memoranda
8 receipts
3 and
1 a
8 register
7 written
7 beneath
5 these
2 we
7 presume
9 indicated
3 the
6 nature
2 of
3 the
6 papers
5 which
3 had
4 been
9 destroyed
2 by
7 colonel
8 openshaw
3 for

9 scattered
6 papers

2 of
1 a

4 were
6 mostly
9 concerned
4 with
8 politics
3 for
2 he
3 had
9 evidently
5 taken
1 a
6 strong
4 part
2 in
8 opposing
3 the

5 heard
2 my
6 father
4 give
1 a
5 sharp
3 cry
2 of
8 surprise
2 as
2 we
3 sat
8 together
2 at

5 table
5 there
2 he
3 was
7 sitting

4 five
5 dried
6 orange
4 pips

6 called

4 cock
3 and
4 bull
5 story
5 about
3 the
7 colonel
3 but
2 he
6 looked
4 very
6 scared
3 and
7 puzzled
3 now
4 that
3 the
4 same
5 thing
3 had
4 come
4 upon
7 himself
3 why
4 what
2 on
5 earth
4 does

4 read
7 peeping
4 over
3 his
8 shoulder
4 what
6 papers

7 sundial
2 he
5 asked
3 the
7 sundial
2 in
3 the
6 garden
5 there

5 other
4 said
1 i
3 but
3 the

8 gripping
4 hard
2 at

7 courage
2 we

4 land
4 here

1 i
8 answered

12 preposterous
9 practical
4 joke
4 said

3 and
6 papers
1 i
5 shall

7 laughed
2 at
3 for
2 my
5 pains

6 forbid
3 you
1 i
3 won
1 t
4 have
1 a
4 fuss
4 made
5 about
4 such
8 nonsense
2 it
3 was
2 in
4 vain
2 to
5 argue
4 with
3 him
3 for
2 he
3 was
1 a
4 very
9 obstinate
3 man
1 i
4 went
5 about
7 however
4 with
1 a
5 heart
5 which
3 was
4 full
2 of
11 forebodings
2 on
3 the
5 third
3 day
5 after
3 the
6 coming
2 of
3 the

3 the
5 forts
4 upon

4 hill
1 i
3 was
4 glad
4 that
2 he
6 should
2 go
3 for
2 it
6 seemed
2 to
2 me
4 that
2 he
3 was
7 farther
4 from
6 danger
4 when
2 he
3 was
4 away
4 from
4 home
2 in
4 that
7 however
1 i
3 was

1 i
8 received
1 a
8 telegram

3 and
3 was
5 lying
9 senseless
4 with
1 a
9 shattered
5 skull
1 i
7 hurried
2 to
3 him
3 but
2 he
6 passed
4 away
7 without
6 having
4 ever
9 recovered
3 his
13 consciousness
2 he
3 had
2 as
2 it
7 appears
4 been
9 returning
4 from
7 fareham
2 in
3 the
8 twilight
3 and
2 as
3 the
7 country
3 was
7 unknown
2 to
3 him
3 and
3 the
5 chalk
3 pit
8 unfenced
3 the
4 jury
3 had
2 no
10 hesitation
2 in
8 bringing

1 i
3 had

4 they
8 listened
2 to
2 my
5 story
4 with
1 a
5 smile
1 i
2 am
9 convinced
4 that
3 the

3 has
6 formed
3 the
7 opinion
4 that
3 the

2 he
5 cried
3 and
5 above
3 all
3 why
3 did
3 you
3 not
4 come
2 at
4 once
1 i
3 did
3 not
4 know
2 it
3 was
4 only
2 to
3 day
4 that
1 i
5 spoke
2 to
5 major
11 prendergast
5 about
2 my
8 troubles
3 and
3 was
7 advised
2 by
3 him
2 to
4 come
2 to
3 you
2 it
2 is
6 really
3 two
4 days
5 since
3 you
3 had
3 the
6 letter
2 we
6 should
4 have
5 acted
6 before
4 this
3 you
4 have
2 no
7 further

3 you
4 have

2 no
10 suggestive
6 detail
5 which
5 might
4 help

5 there
2 is

5 thing
4 said
4 john
8 openshaw
2 he
8 rummaged
2 in
3 his
4 coat
6 pocket
3 and
7 drawing
3 out
1 a
5 piece
2 of
11 discoloured
4 blue
6 tinted
5 paper
2 he
4 laid
2 it
3 out
4 upon
3 the
5 table
1 i
4 have
4 some
11 remembrance
4 said
2 he
4 that
2 on
3 the
3 day
4 when
2 my
5 uncle
6 burned
3 the
6 papers
1 i
8 observed
4 that
3 the
5 small
8 unburned
7 margins
5 which
3 lay
4 amid
3 the
5 ashes
4 were
2 of
4 this
10 particular
6 colour
1 i
5 found
4 this
6 single
5 sheet
4 upon
3 the
5 floor
2 of
3 his
4 room
3 and
1 i
2 am
8 inclined
2 to
5 think
4 that
2 it
3 may
2 be
3 one
2 of
3 the
6 papers
5 which
3 has
7 perhaps
9 fluttered
3 out
4 from
5 among
3 the
6 others
3 and
2 in
4 that
3 way
3 has
7 escaped
11 destruction
6 beyond
3 the
7 mention
2 of
4 pips
1 i
2 do
3 not
3 see
4 that
2 it
5 helps
2 us
4 much
1 i
5 think
6 myself
4 that
2 it
2 is
1 a
4 page
4 from
4 some
7 private
5 diary
3 the
7 writing
2 is
11 undoubtedly
2 my
5 uncle
1 s
6 holmes
5 moved
3 the
4 lamp
3 and
2 we
4 both
4 bent
4 over
3 the
5 sheet
2 of
5 paper
5 which
6 showed
2 by
3 its
6 ragged
4 edge
4 that
2 it
3 had
6 indeed
4 been
4 torn
4 from
1 a
4 book
2 it
3 was

6 holmes
7 folding
2 up
3 the
5 paper
3 and
9 returning

2 to
3 our
7 visitor
3 and
3 now
3 you
4 must
2 on

4 lose
7 another
7 instant
2 we
6 cannot
5 spare
4 time
4 even
2 to
7 discuss
4 what
3 you
4 have
4 told
2 me
3 you
4 must
3 get
4 home
9 instantly
3 and
3 act
4 what
5 shall
1 i
2 do
5 there
2 is
3 but
3 one
5 thing
2 to
2 do
2 it
4 must
2 be
4 done
2 at
4 once
3 you
4 must
3 put
4 this
5 piece
2 of
5 paper
5 which
3 you
4 have
5 shown
2 us
4 into
3 the
5 brass
3 box
5 which
3 you
4 have
9 described
3 you
4 must
4 also
3 put
2 in
1 a
4 note
2 to
3 say
4 that
3 all
3 the
5 other
6 papers
4 were
6 burned
2 by
4 your
5 uncle
3 and
4 that
4 this
2 is
3 the
4 only
3 one
5 which
7 remains
3 you
4 must
6 assert
4 that
2 in
4 such
5 words
2 as
4 will
5 carry
10 conviction
4 with
4 them
6 having
4 done
4 this
3 you
4 must
2 at
4 once
3 put
3 the
3 box
3 out
4 upon
3 the
7 sundial
2 as
8 directed
2 do
3 you
10 understand
8 entirely
2 do
3 not
5 think
2 of
7 revenge
2 or
8 anything
2 of
3 the
4 sort
2 at
7 present
1 i
5 think
4 that
2 we
3 may
4 gain
4 that
2 by
5 means
2 of
3 the
3 law
3 but
2 we
4 have
3 our
3 web
2 to
5 weave
5 while
6 theirs
2 is
7 already
5 woven
3 the
5 first
13 consideration
2 is
2 to
6 remove
3 the
8 pressing
6 danger
5 which
9 threatens
3 you
3 the
6 second
2 is
2 to
5 clear
2 up
3 the
7 mystery
3 and
2 to
6 punish
3 the
6 guilty
7 parties
1 i
5 thank
3 you

5 given
2 me
5 fresh
4 life
3 and

1 i
5 shall
9 certainly
2 do
2 as
3 you
6 advise
2 do
3 not
4 lose
2 an
7 instant
3 and
5 above
3 all
4 take
4 care
2 of
8 yourself
2 in
3 the
9 meanwhile
3 for
1 i
2 do
3 not
5 think
4 that
5 there
3 can
2 be
1 a
5 doubt
4 that
3 you
3 are
10 threatened
2 by
1 a
4 very
4 real
3 and
8 imminent
6 danger
3 how
2 do

3 yet
4 nine
3 the

1 i
5 trust
4 that
3 you
3 may
2 be

3 yet
3 you
6 cannot
5 guard
8 yourself
3 too
7 closely

2 he
5 shook
5 hands
4 with

4 took
3 his
5 leave
7 outside
3 the

5 still
8 screamed
3 and
3 the
4 rain
8 splashed
3 and
8 pattered
7 against
3 the

4 this
7 strange
4 wild
5 story
6 seemed
2 to
4 have
4 come
2 to
2 us
4 from
4 amid
3 the
3 mad
8 elements
5 blown
2 in
4 upon

3 and
3 his
4 eyes
4 bent
4 upon
3 the

2 he
3 lit

3 and
7 leaning

2 he
7 watched

2 as
4 they
6 chased
4 each
5 other
2 up
2 to
3 the
7 ceiling
1 i
5 think
6 watson
2 he
8 remarked
2 at
4 last
4 that
2 of
3 all
3 our
5 cases
2 we
4 have
3 had
4 none
4 more
9 fantastic
4 than
4 this
4 save
7 perhaps
3 the
4 sign
2 of
4 four
4 well
3 yes
4 save
7 perhaps
4 that
3 and
3 yet
4 this
4 john
8 openshaw
5 seems
2 to
2 me
2 to
2 be
7 walking
4 amid
4 even
7 greater
6 perils
4 than
3 did
3 the
7 sholtos
3 but
4 have
3 you
1 i
5 asked
6 formed
3 any
8 definite
10 conception
2 as
2 to
4 what
5 these
6 perils
3 are
5 there
3 can
2 be
2 no
8 question
2 as
2 to
5 their

3 who

6 holmes
6 closed
3 his

3 and
6 placed
3 his

4 upon
3 the
4 arms
2 of
3 his
5 chair
4 with
3 his
6 finger
4 tips
8 together
3 the
5 ideal
8 reasoner
2 he
8 remarked
5 would
4 when
2 he
3 had
4 once
4 been
5 shown
1 a
6 single
4 fact
2 in
3 all
3 its
8 bearings
6 deduce
4 from
2 it
3 not
4 only
3 all
3 the
5 chain
2 of
6 events
5 which
3 led
2 up
2 to
2 it
3 but
4 also
3 all
3 the
7 results
5 which
5 would
6 follow
4 from
2 it
2 as
6 cuvier
5 could
9 correctly
8 describe
1 a
5 whole

2 by
3 the
13 contemplation
2 of
1 a

2 so
3 the
8 observer
3 who
3 has
10 thoroughly
10 understood
3 one
4 link
2 in
1 a
6 series
2 of
9 incidents
6 should
2 be
4 able
2 to
10 accurately
5 state
3 all
3 the
5 other
4 ones
4 both
6 before
3 and
5 after
2 we
4 have
3 not
3 yet
7 grasped
3 the
7 results
5 which
3 the
6 reason
5 alone
3 can
6 attain
2 to
8 problems
3 may
2 be
6 solved
2 in
3 the
5 study
5 which
4 have
7 baffled
3 all
5 those
3 who
4 have
6 sought
1 a
8 solution
2 by
3 the
3 aid
2 of
5 their
6 senses
2 to
5 carry
3 the
3 art
7 however
2 to
3 its
7 highest
5 pitch
2 it
2 is
9 necessary
4 that
3 the
8 reasoner
6 should
2 be
4 able
2 to
7 utilise
3 all
3 the
5 facts
5 which
4 have
4 come
2 to
3 his
9 knowledge
3 and
4 this
2 in
6 itself
7 implies
2 as
3 you
4 will
7 readily
3 see
1 a
10 possession
2 of
3 all
9 knowledge
5 which
4 even
2 in
5 these
4 days
2 of
4 free
9 education
3 and
14 encyclopaedias
2 is
1 a
8 somewhat
4 rare
14 accomplishment
2 it
2 is
3 not
2 so
10 impossible
7 however
4 that
1 a
3 man
6 should
7 possess
3 all
9 knowledge
5 which
2 is
6 likely
2 to
2 be
6 useful
2 to
3 him
2 in
3 his
4 work
3 and
4 this
1 i
4 have
11 endeavoured
2 in
2 my
4 case
2 to
2 do
2 if
1 i
8 remember
7 rightly
3 you
2 on
3 one
8 occasion
2 in
3 the
5 early
4 days
2 of
3 our
10 friendship
7 defined
2 my
6 limits
2 in
1 a
4 very
7 precise
7 fashion
3 yes
1 i
8 answered
8 laughing
2 it
3 was
1 a
8 singular
8 document
10 philosophy
9 astronomy
3 and
8 politics
4 were

2 at

3 for

1 a

2 as
3 the
3 one
5 which
3 has
4 been
9 submitted
2 to
2 us
2 to
5 night
2 we
4 need
9 certainly
2 to
6 muster
3 all
3 our
9 resources
6 kindly
4 hand
2 me
4 down
3 the

1 k
2 of
3 the
8 american
13 encyclopaedia
5 which
6 stands
4 upon
3 the
5 shelf
6 beside
3 you
5 thank
3 you
3 now
3 let
2 us
8 consider
3 the
9 situation
3 and
3 see
4 what
3 may
2 be
7 deduced
4 from
2 it
2 in
3 the
5 first
5 place
2 we
3 may
5 start
4 with
1 a
6 strong
11 presumption
4 that
7 colonel
8 openshaw
3 had
4 some
4 very
6 strong
6 reason
3 for
7 leaving
7 america
3 men
2 at
3 his
4 time
2 of
4 life
2 do
3 not
6 change
3 all
5 their
6 habits
3 and
8 exchange
9 willingly
3 the
8 charming
7 climate
2 of
7 florida
3 for
3 the
6 lonely
4 life
2 of
2 an
7 english
10 provincial
4 town
3 his
7 extreme
4 love
2 of
8 solitude
2 in
7 england
8 suggests
3 the
4 idea
4 that
2 he
3 was
2 in
4 fear
2 of
7 someone
2 or
9 something
2 so
2 we
3 may
6 assume
2 as
1 a
7 working
10 hypothesis
4 that
2 it
3 was
4 fear
2 of
7 someone
2 or
9 something
5 which
5 drove
3 him
4 from
7 america
2 as
2 to
4 what
2 it
3 was
2 he
6 feared
2 we
3 can
4 only
6 deduce
4 that
2 by
11 considering
3 the
10 formidable
7 letters
5 which
4 were
8 received
2 by
7 himself
3 and
3 his
10 successors
3 did
3 you
6 remark
3 the
9 postmarks
2 of
5 those
7 letters
3 the
5 first
3 was
4 from
11 pondicherry
3 the
6 second
4 from
6 dundee
3 and
3 the
5 third
4 from
6 london
4 from
4 east
6 london
4 what
2 do
3 you
6 deduce
4 from
4 that
4 they
3 are
3 all
8 seaports
4 that
3 the
6 writer
3 was
2 on
5 board
2 of
1 a
4 ship
9 excellent
2 we
4 have
7 already
1 a
4 clue
5 there
3 can
2 be
2 no
5 doubt
4 that
3 the
11 probability
3 the
6 strong
11 probability
2 is
4 that
3 the
6 writer
3 was
2 on
5 board
2 of
1 a
4 ship
3 and
3 now
3 let
2 us
8 consider
7 another
5 point
2 in
3 the
4 case
2 of
11 pondicherry
5 seven
5 weeks
7 elapsed
7 between
3 the
6 threat
3 and
3 its
10 fulfilment
2 in
6 dundee
2 it
3 was
4 only
4 some
5 three
2 or
4 four
4 days
4 does
4 that
7 suggest
8 anything
1 a
7 greater
8 distance
2 to
6 travel
3 but
3 the
6 letter
3 had
4 also
1 a
7 greater
8 distance
2 to
4 come
4 then
1 i
2 do
3 not
3 see
3 the
5 point
5 there
2 is
2 at
5 least
1 a
11 presumption
4 that
3 the
6 vessel
2 in
5 which
3 the
3 man
2 or
3 men
3 are
2 is
1 a
7 sailing
4 ship
2 it
5 looks
2 as
2 if
4 they
6 always
4 send
5 their
8 singular
7 warning
2 or
5 token
6 before
4 them
4 when
8 starting
4 upon
5 their
7 mission
3 you
3 see
3 how
7 quickly
3 the
4 deed
8 followed
3 the
4 sign
4 when
2 it
4 came
4 from
6 dundee
2 if
4 they
3 had
4 come
4 from
11 pondicherry
2 in
1 a
7 steamer
4 they
5 would
4 have
7 arrived
6 almost
2 as
4 soon
2 as
5 their
6 letter
3 but
2 as
1 a
6 matter
2 of
4 fact
5 seven
5 weeks
7 elapsed
1 i
5 think
4 that
5 those
5 seven
5 weeks
11 represented
3 the
10 difference
7 between
3 the
4 mail
4 boat
5 which
7 brought
3 the
6 letter
3 and
3 the
7 sailing
6 vessel
5 which
7 brought
3 the
6 writer
2 it
2 is
8 possible
4 more
4 than
4 that
2 it
2 is
8 probable
3 and
3 now
3 you
3 see
3 the
6 deadly
7 urgency
2 of
4 this
3 new
4 case
3 and
3 why
1 i
5 urged
5 young
8 openshaw
2 to
7 caution
3 the
4 blow
3 has
6 always
6 fallen
2 at
3 the
3 end
2 of
3 the
4 time
5 which
2 it
5 would
4 take
3 the
7 senders
2 to
6 travel
3 the
8 distance
3 but
4 this
3 one
5 comes
4 from
6 london
3 and
9 therefore
2 we
6 cannot
5 count
4 upon
5 delay
4 good
3 god
1 i
5 cried
4 what
3 can
2 it
4 mean
4 this
10 relentless
11 persecution
3 the
6 papers
5 which
8 openshaw
7 carried
3 are
9 obviously
2 of
5 vital
10 importance
2 to
3 the
6 person
2 or
7 persons
2 in
3 the
7 sailing
4 ship
1 i
5 think
4 that
2 it
2 is
5 quite
5 clear
4 that
5 there
4 must
2 be
4 more
4 than
3 one
2 of
4 them
1 a
6 single
3 man
5 could
3 not
4 have
7 carried
3 out
3 two
6 deaths
2 in
4 such
1 a
3 way
2 as
2 to
7 deceive
1 a
7 coroner
1 s
4 jury
5 there
4 must
4 have
4 been
7 several
2 in
2 it
3 and
4 they
4 must
4 have
4 been
3 men
2 of
8 resource
3 and
13 determination
5 their
6 papers
4 they
4 mean
2 to
4 have
2 be
3 the
6 holder
2 of
4 them
3 who
2 it
3 may
2 in
4 this
3 way
3 you
3 see
1 k
1 k
1 k
6 ceases
2 to
2 be
3 the
8 initials
2 of
2 an
10 individual
3 and
7 becomes
3 the
5 badge
2 of
1 a
7 society
3 but
2 of
4 what
7 society
4 have
3 you
5 never
4 said
8 sherlock
6 holmes
7 bending
7 forward
3 and
7 sinking
3 his

4 have
3 you
5 never
5 heard

5 never
4 have
6 holmes
6 turned
4 over

4 upon

4 here
2 it
2 is

9 presently
2 ku
4 klux
4 klan
1 a

7 derived
4 from
3 the
8 fanciful
11 resemblance
2 to
3 the
5 sound
8 produced
2 by
7 cocking
1 a
5 rifle
4 this
8 terrible
6 secret
7 society
3 was
6 formed
2 by
4 some
2 ex
11 confederate
8 soldiers
2 in
3 the
8 southern
6 states
5 after
3 the
5 civil
3 war
3 and
2 it
7 rapidly
6 formed
5 local
8 branches
2 in
9 different
5 parts
2 of
3 the
7 country
7 notably
2 in
9 tennessee
9 louisiana
3 the
9 carolinas
7 georgia
3 and
7 florida
3 its
5 power
3 was
4 used
3 for
9 political
8 purposes
11 principally
3 for
3 the
11 terrorising
2 of
3 the
5 negro
6 voters
3 and
3 the
9 murdering
3 and
7 driving
4 from
3 the
7 country
2 of
5 those
3 who
4 were
7 opposed
2 to
3 its
5 views
3 its
8 outrages
4 were
7 usually
8 preceded
2 by
1 a
7 warning
4 sent
2 to
3 the
6 marked
3 man
2 in
4 some
9 fantastic
3 but
9 generally
10 recognised
5 shape
1 a
5 sprig
2 of
3 oak
6 leaves
2 in
4 some
5 parts
5 melon
5 seeds
2 or
6 orange
4 pips
2 in
6 others
2 on
9 receiving
4 this
3 the
6 victim
5 might
6 either
6 openly
6 abjure
3 his
6 former
4 ways
2 or
5 might
3 fly
4 from
3 the
7 country
2 if
2 he
6 braved
3 the
6 matter
3 out
5 death
5 would
11 unfailingly
4 come
4 upon
3 him
3 and
7 usually
2 in
4 some
7 strange
3 and
10 unforeseen
6 manner
2 so
7 perfect
3 was
3 the
12 organisation
2 of
3 the
7 society
3 and
2 so
10 systematic
3 its
7 methods
4 that
5 there
2 is
6 hardly
1 a
4 case
4 upon
6 record
5 where
3 any
3 man
9 succeeded
2 in
7 braving
2 it
4 with
8 impunity
2 or
2 in
5 which
3 any
2 of
3 its
8 outrages
4 were
6 traced
4 home
2 to
3 the
12 perpetrators
3 for
4 some
5 years
3 the
12 organisation
10 flourished
2 in
5 spite
2 of
3 the
7 efforts
2 of
3 the
6 united
6 states
10 government
3 and
2 of
3 the
6 better
7 classes
2 of
3 the
9 community
2 in
3 the
5 south
10 eventually
2 in
3 the
4 year
3 the
8 movement
6 rather
8 suddenly
9 collapsed
8 although
5 there
4 have
4 been
8 sporadic
9 outbreaks
2 of
3 the
4 same
4 sort
5 since
4 that
4 date
3 you
4 will
7 observe
4 said
6 holmes
6 laying
4 down
3 the
6 volume
4 that
3 the
6 sudden
8 breaking
2 up
2 of
3 the
7 society
3 was
10 coincident
4 with
3 the
13 disappearance
2 of
8 openshaw
4 from
7 america
4 with
5 their
6 papers
2 it
3 may
4 well
4 have
4 been
5 cause
3 and
6 effect
2 it
2 is
2 no
6 wonder
4 that
2 he
3 and
3 his
6 family
4 have
4 some
2 of
3 the
4 more
10 implacable
7 spirits
4 upon
5 their
5 track
3 you
3 can
10 understand
4 that
4 this
8 register
3 and
5 diary
3 may
9 implicate
4 some
2 of
3 the
5 first
3 men
2 in
3 the
5 south
3 and
4 that
5 there
3 may
2 be
4 many
3 who
4 will
3 not
5 sleep
4 easy
2 at
5 night
5 until
2 it
2 is
9 recovered
4 then
3 the
4 page
2 we
4 have
4 seen
2 is
4 such
2 as
2 we
5 might
6 expect
2 it
3 ran
2 if
1 i
8 remember
5 right
4 sent
3 the
4 pips
2 to
1 a
1 b
3 and
1 c
4 that
2 is
4 sent
3 the
7 society
1 s
7 warning
2 to
4 them
4 then
5 there
3 are
10 successive
7 entries
4 that
1 a
3 and
1 b
7 cleared
2 or
4 left
3 the
7 country
3 and
7 finally
4 that
1 c
3 was
7 visited
4 with
1 i
4 fear
1 a
8 sinister
6 result
3 for
1 c
4 well
1 i
5 think
6 doctor
4 that
2 we
3 may
3 let
4 some
5 light
4 into
4 this
4 dark
5 place
3 and
1 i
7 believe
4 that
3 the
4 only
6 chance
5 young
8 openshaw
3 has
2 in
3 the
8 meantime
2 is
2 to
2 do
4 what
1 i
4 have
4 told
3 him
5 there
2 is
7 nothing
4 more
2 to
2 be
4 said
2 or
2 to
2 be
4 done
2 to
5 night
2 so
4 hand
2 me
4 over
2 my
6 violin
3 and
3 let
2 us
3 try
2 to
6 forget
3 for
4 half
2 an
4 hour
3 the
9 miserable
7 weather
3 and
3 the
5 still
4 more
9 miserable
4 ways
2 of
3 our
6 fellow
3 men
2 it
3 had
7 cleared
2 in
3 the
7 morning
3 and
3 the
3 sun
3 was
7 shining
4 with
1 a
7 subdued
10 brightness
7 through
3 the
3 dim
4 veil
5 which
5 hangs
4 over
3 the
5 great
4 city
8 sherlock
6 holmes
3 was
7 already
2 at
9 breakfast
4 when
1 i
4 came
4 down
3 you
4 will
6 excuse
2 me
3 for
3 not
7 waiting
3 for
3 you
4 said
2 he
1 i
4 have
1 i
7 foresee
1 a
4 very
4 busy
3 day
6 before
2 me
2 in
7 looking
4 into
4 this
4 case
2 of
5 young
8 openshaw
1 s
4 what
5 steps
4 will
3 you
4 take
1 i
5 asked
2 it
4 will
4 very
4 much
6 depend
4 upon
3 the
7 results
2 of
2 my
5 first
9 inquiries
1 i
3 may
4 have
2 to
2 go
4 down
2 to
7 horsham
5 after
3 all
3 you
4 will
3 not
2 go
5 there
5 first
2 no
1 i
5 shall
8 commence
4 with
3 the
4 city
4 just
4 ring
3 the
4 bell
3 and
3 the
4 maid
4 will
5 bring
2 up
4 your
6 coffee
2 as
1 i
6 waited
1 i
6 lifted
3 the
8 unopened
9 newspaper
4 from
3 the
5 table
3 and
7 glanced
2 my
3 eye
4 over
2 it
2 it
6 rested
4 upon
1 a
7 heading
5 which
4 sent
1 a
5 chill
2 to
2 my
5 heart
6 holmes
1 i
5 cried
3 you
3 are
3 too
4 late
2 ah
4 said
2 he
6 laying
4 down
3 his
3 cup
1 i
6 feared
2 as
4 much
3 how
3 was
2 it
4 done
2 he
5 spoke
6 calmly
3 but
1 i
5 could
3 see
4 that
2 he
3 was
6 deeply
5 moved
2 my
3 eye
6 caught
3 the
4 name
2 of
8 openshaw
3 and
3 the
7 heading
7 tragedy
4 near
8 waterloo
6 bridge
4 here
2 is
3 the
7 account
7 between
4 nine
3 and
3 ten
4 last
5 night
6 police
9 constable
4 cook
2 of
3 the
1 h
8 division
2 on
4 duty
4 near
8 waterloo
6 bridge
5 heard
1 a
3 cry
3 for
4 help
3 and
1 a
6 splash
2 in
3 the
5 water
3 the
5 night
7 however
3 was
9 extremely
4 dark
3 and
6 stormy
2 so
4 that
2 in
5 spite
2 of
3 the
4 help
2 of
7 several
7 passers
2 by
2 it
3 was
5 quite
10 impossible
2 to
6 effect
1 a
6 rescue
3 the
5 alarm
7 however
3 was
5 given
3 and
2 by
3 the
3 aid
2 of
3 the
5 water
6 police
3 the
4 body
3 was
10 eventually
9 recovered
2 it
6 proved
2 to
2 be
4 that
2 of
1 a
5 young
9 gentleman
5 whose
4 name
2 as
2 it
7 appears
4 from
2 an
8 envelope
5 which
3 was
5 found
2 in
3 his
6 pocket
3 was
4 john
8 openshaw
3 and
5 whose
9 residence
2 is
4 near
7 horsham
2 it
2 is
11 conjectured
4 that
2 he
3 may
4 have
4 been
8 hurrying
4 down
2 to
5 catch
3 the
4 last
5 train
4 from
8 waterloo
7 station
3 and
4 that
2 in
3 his
5 haste
3 and
3 the
7 extreme
8 darkness
2 he
6 missed
3 his
4 path
3 and
6 walked
4 over
3 the
4 edge
2 of
3 one
2 of
3 the
5 small
7 landing
6 places
3 for
5 river
10 steamboats
3 the
4 body
9 exhibited
2 no
6 traces
2 of
8 violence
3 and
5 there
3 can
2 be
2 no
5 doubt
4 that
3 the
8 deceased
3 had
4 been
3 the
6 victim
2 of
2 an
11 unfortunate
8 accident
5 which
6 should
4 have
3 the
6 effect
2 of
7 calling
3 the
9 attention
2 of
3 the
11 authorities
2 to
