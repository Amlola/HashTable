7 minutes
2 or
4 even
4 less
2 he
3 had
9 forgotten
3 all

4 were
3 one
4 whit
4 less
5 heavy
3 and
6 bitter
2 to
3 him
4 than
1 a
3 man
1 s
3 are
2 to
1 a
3 man
3 but
7 because
1 a
3 new
3 and
8 powerful
8 interest
4 bore
4 them
4 down
3 and
5 drove
4 them
3 out
2 of
3 his
4 mind
3 for
3 the
4 time
4 just
2 as
3 men
1 s
11 misfortunes
3 are
9 forgotten
2 in
3 the
10 excitement
2 of
3 new
11 enterprises
4 this
3 new
8 interest
3 was
1 a
6 valued
7 novelty
2 in
9 whistling
5 which
2 he
3 had
4 just
8 acquired
4 from
1 a
5 negro
3 and
2 he
3 was
9 suffering

2 it
11 undisturbed
2 it
9 consisted
2 in

4 bird
4 like

6 warble
8 produced
2 by

2 of

9 intervals
2 in

8 probably
9 remembers
3 how
2 to
2 do
2 it
2 if
2 he
3 has
4 ever
4 been
1 a
3 boy
9 diligence
3 and
9 attention
4 soon
4 gave
3 him
3 the
5 knack
2 of
2 it
3 and
2 he
6 strode
4 down
3 the
6 street
4 with
3 his
5 mouth
4 full
2 of
7 harmony
3 and
3 his
4 soul
4 full
2 of
9 gratitude
2 he
4 felt
4 much
2 as

5 feels
3 who

10 discovered
1 a

6 planet
2 no

1 a
8 tingling
4 rear
3 tom
3 was
12 whitewashing

3 tom
1 s
6 energy
3 did
3 not
4 last
2 he
5 began
2 to
5 think
2 of
3 the
3 fun
2 he
3 had
7 planned
3 for
4 this
3 day
3 and
3 his
7 sorrows
10 multiplied
4 soon
3 the
4 free
4 boys
5 would
4 come
8 tripping
5 along
2 on
3 all

3 him
4 like

2 he
3 got
3 out
3 his
7 worldly
6 wealth
3 and
8 examined
2 it
4 bits
2 of
4 toys
7 marbles
3 and
5 trash
6 enough
2 to
3 buy
2 an
8 exchange
2 of

5 maybe
3 but
3 not
4 half
6 enough
2 to
3 buy
2 so
4 much
2 as
4 half
2 an
4 hour
2 of
4 pure
7 freedom
2 so
2 he
8 returned
3 his
10 straitened
5 means
2 to
3 his
6 pocket
3 and
4 gave
2 up
3 the
4 idea
2 of
6 trying
2 to
3 buy
3 the
4 boys
2 at
4 this
4 dark
3 and
8 hopeless
6 moment
2 an
11 inspiration
5 burst
4 upon
3 him
7 nothing
4 less
4 than
1 a
5 great
11 magnificent
11 inspiration
2 he
4 took
2 up

6 enough
4 that

4 such
1 a

5 world
5 after

7 without

6 namely
4 that
2 in

2 to
4 make
1 a

2 or
1 a

5 covet
1 a

11 philosopher
4 like
3 the
6 writer
2 of

8 consists
2 of
8 whatever
1 a

8 consists
2 of
8 whatever
1 a
4 body
2 is
3 not
7 obliged
2 to
2 do
3 and
4 this
5 would
4 help
3 him
2 to
10 understand
3 why
12 constructing
10 artificial
7 flowers
2 or
10 performing
2 on
1 a
5 tread
4 mill
2 is
4 work
5 while

12 considerable
5 money
3 but
2 if
4 they
4 were
7 offered
5 wages
3 for

4 that
5 would
4 turn

4 into

3 and

11 whitewashed
3 but
11 elaborately
6 coated

3 was

4 that
3 she
4 took
3 him
4 into
3 the

3 and
8 selected
1 a
6 choice
5 apple
3 and
9 delivered
2 it
2 to

10 scriptural

2 he
6 hooked
1 a

4 then
2 he
7 skipped

3 and

8 starting
2 up
3 the

4 that
3 led

2 of

2 in
1 a

4 they
5 raged
6 around

5 there
3 was
1 a
4 gate
3 but
2 as
1 a
7 general
5 thing
2 he
3 was
3 too
7 crowded
3 for

2 to
4 make
3 use
2 of
2 it
3 his

3 was
2 at

2 to

3 and
7 getting
3 him
4 into
7 trouble
3 tom
7 skirted
3 the
5 block
3 and
4 came
5 round
4 into
1 a
5 muddy
5 alley
4 that
3 led
2 by
3 the
4 back
2 of
3 his
4 aunt
1 s

2 he
9 presently
3 got
6 safely
6 beyond

2 of
7 capture
3 and
10 punishment
3 and
8 hastened
6 toward
3 the
6 public
6 square
2 of

7 village
5 where
3 two
8 military
9 companies
2 of

3 the

4 fell
4 into

3 and
7 marched
4 away
3 and
3 tom
6 turned
8 homeward
5 alone
2 as
2 he
3 was
7 passing
2 by
3 the
5 house
5 where
4 jeff
8 thatcher
5 lived
2 he
3 saw
1 a
3 new
4 girl
2 in
3 the
6 garden
1 a
6 lovely
6 little
4 blue
4 eyed
8 creature
4 with
6 yellow
4 hair
7 plaited
4 into
3 two
4 long
5 tails
5 white
6 summer
5 frock
3 and
11 embroidered
11 pantalettes
3 the
5 fresh
7 crowned
4 hero
4 fell
7 without
6 firing
1 a
4 shot
1 a
7 certain
3 amy
8 lawrence
8 vanished
3 out
2 of
3 his
5 heart
3 and
4 left
3 not
4 even
1 a
6 memory
2 of
7 herself
6 behind
2 he
3 had
7 thought
2 he
5 loved
3 her
2 to
11 distraction
2 he
3 had
8 regarded
3 his
7 passion
2 as
9 adoration
3 and
6 behold
2 it
3 was
4 only
1 a
4 poor
6 little
10 evanescent
10 partiality
2 he
3 had
4 been
6 months
7 winning
3 her
3 she
3 had
9 confessed
6 hardly
1 a
4 week
3 ago
2 he
3 had
4 been
3 the
8 happiest
3 and
3 the
8 proudest
3 boy
2 in
3 the
5 world
4 only
5 seven
5 short
4 days
3 and
4 here
2 in
3 one
7 instant
2 of
4 time
3 she
3 had
4 gone
3 out
2 of
3 his
5 heart
4 like
1 a
6 casual
8 stranger
5 whose
5 visit
2 is
4 done
2 he
10 worshipped
4 this
3 new
5 angel
4 with
7 furtive
3 eye
4 till
2 he
3 saw
4 that
3 she
3 had
10 discovered
3 him
4 then
2 he
9 pretended
2 he
3 did
3 not
4 know
3 she
3 was
7 present
3 and
5 began
2 to
4 show
3 off
2 in
3 all
5 sorts
2 of
6 absurd
6 boyish
4 ways
2 in
5 order
2 to
3 win
3 her
10 admiration
2 he
4 kept
2 up
4 this
9 grotesque
11 foolishness
3 for
4 some
4 time
3 but
2 by
3 and
2 by
5 while
2 he
3 was
2 in
3 the
5 midst
2 of
4 some
9 dangerous
9 gymnastic
12 performances
2 he
7 glanced
5 aside
3 and
3 saw
4 that
3 the
6 little
4 girl
3 was
7 wending
3 her
3 way
6 toward
3 the
5 house
3 tom
4 came
2 up
2 to
3 the
5 fence
3 and
6 leaned
2 on
2 it
8 grieving
3 and
6 hoping
3 she
5 would
5 tarry
3 yet
6 awhile
6 longer
3 she
6 halted
1 a
6 moment
2 on
3 the
5 steps
3 and
4 then
5 moved
6 toward
3 the
4 door
3 tom
6 heaved
1 a
5 great
4 sigh
2 as
3 she
3 put
3 her
4 foot
2 on
3 the
9 threshold
3 but
3 his
4 face
3 lit
2 up
5 right
4 away
3 for
3 she
6 tossed
1 a
5 pansy
4 over
3 the
5 fence
1 a
6 moment
6 before
3 she
11 disappeared
3 the
3 boy
3 ran
6 around
3 and
7 stopped
6 within
1 a
4 foot
2 or
3 two
2 of
3 the
6 flower
3 and
4 then
6 shaded
3 his
4 eyes
4 with
3 his
4 hand
3 and
5 began
2 to
4 look
4 down
6 street
2 as
2 if
2 he
3 had
10 discovered
9 something
2 of
8 interest
5 going
2 on
2 in
4 that
9 direction
9 presently
2 he
6 picked
2 up
1 a
5 straw
3 and
5 began
6 trying
2 to
7 balance
2 it
2 on
3 his
4 nose
4 with
3 his
4 head
6 tilted
3 far
4 back
3 and
2 as
2 he
5 moved
4 from
4 side
2 to
4 side
2 in
3 his
7 efforts
2 he
5 edged
6 nearer
3 and
6 nearer
6 toward
3 the
5 pansy
7 finally
3 his
4 bare
4 foot
6 rested
4 upon
2 it
3 his
6 pliant
4 toes
6 closed
4 upon
2 it
3 and
2 he
6 hopped
4 away
4 with
3 the
8 treasure
3 and
11 disappeared
5 round
3 the
6 corner
3 but
4 only
3 for
1 a
6 minute
4 only
5 while
2 he
5 could
6 button
3 the
6 flower
6 inside
3 his
6 jacket
4 next
3 his
5 heart
2 or
4 next
3 his
7 stomach
8 possibly
3 for
2 he
3 was
3 not
4 much
6 posted
2 in
7 anatomy
3 and
3 not
13 hypercritical
6 anyway
2 he
8 returned
3 now
3 and
4 hung
5 about
3 the
5 fence
4 till
9 nightfall
7 showing
3 off
2 as
6 before
3 but
3 the
4 girl
5 never
9 exhibited
7 herself
5 again
6 though
3 tom
9 comforted
7 himself
1 a
6 little
4 with
3 the
4 hope
4 that
3 she
3 had
4 been
4 near
4 some
6 window
8 meantime
3 and
4 been
5 aware
2 of
3 his
10 attentions
7 finally
2 he
6 strode
4 home
11 reluctantly
4 with
3 his
4 poor
4 head
4 full
2 of
7 visions
3 all
7 through
6 supper
3 his
7 spirits
4 were
2 so
4 high
4 that
3 his
4 aunt
8 wondered
4 what
3 had
3 got
4 into
3 the
5 child
2 he
4 took
1 a
4 good
8 scolding
5 about
8 clodding
3 sid
3 and
3 did
3 not
4 seem
2 to
4 mind
2 it
2 in
3 the
5 least
2 he
5 tried
2 to
5 steal
5 sugar
5 under
3 his
4 aunt
1 s
4 very
4 nose
3 and
3 got
3 his
8 knuckles
6 rapped
3 for
2 it
2 he
4 said
4 aunt
3 you
3 don
1 t
5 whack
3 sid
4 when
2 he
5 takes
2 it
4 well
3 sid
3 don
1 t
7 torment
1 a
4 body
3 the
3 way
3 you
2 do
3 you
1 d
2 be
6 always
4 into
4 that
5 sugar
2 if
1 i
4 warn
1 t
8 watching
3 you
9 presently
3 she
7 stepped
4 into
3 the
7 kitchen
3 and
3 sid
5 happy
2 in
3 his
8 immunity
7 reached
3 for
3 the
5 sugar
4 bowl
1 a
4 sort
2 of
8 glorying
4 over
3 tom
5 which
3 was
8 wellnigh
10 unbearable
3 but
3 sid
1 s
7 fingers
7 slipped
3 and
3 the
4 bowl
7 dropped
3 and
5 broke
3 tom
3 was
2 in
9 ecstasies
2 in
4 such
9 ecstasies
4 that
2 he
4 even
10 controlled
3 his
6 tongue
3 and
3 was
6 silent
2 he
4 said
2 to
7 himself
4 that
2 he
5 would
3 not
5 speak
1 a
4 word
4 even
4 when
3 his
4 aunt
4 came
2 in
3 but
5 would
3 sit
9 perfectly
5 still
4 till
3 she
5 asked
3 who
3 did
3 the
8 mischief
3 and
4 then
2 he
5 would
4 tell
3 and
5 there
5 would
2 be
7 nothing
2 so
4 good
2 in
3 the
5 world
2 as
2 to
3 see
4 that
3 pet
5 model
5 catch
2 it
2 he
3 was
2 so
7 brimful
2 of
10 exultation
4 that
2 he
5 could
6 hardly
4 hold
7 himself
4 when
3 the
3 old
4 lady
4 came
4 back
3 and
5 stood
5 above
3 the
5 wreck
11 discharging
10 lightnings
2 of
5 wrath
4 from
4 over
3 her
10 spectacles
2 he
4 said
2 to
7 himself
3 now
2 it
1 s
6 coming
3 and
3 the
4 next
7 instant
2 he
3 was
9 sprawling
2 on
3 the
5 floor
3 the
6 potent
4 palm
3 was
8 uplifted
2 to
6 strike
5 again
4 when
3 tom
5 cried
3 out
4 hold
2 on
3 now
4 what
2 er
3 you
7 belting
2 me
3 for
3 sid
5 broke
2 it
4 aunt
5 polly
6 paused
9 perplexed
3 and
3 tom
6 looked
3 for
7 healing
4 pity
3 but
4 when
3 she
3 got
3 her
6 tongue
5 again
3 she
4 only
4 said
3 umf
4 well
3 you
4 didn
1 t
3 get
1 a
4 lick
5 amiss
1 i
6 reckon
3 you
4 been
4 into
4 some
5 other
9 audacious
8 mischief
4 when
1 i
4 wasn
1 t
6 around
4 like
6 enough
4 then
3 her
10 conscience
10 reproached
3 her
3 and
3 she
7 yearned
2 to
3 say
9 something
4 kind
3 and
6 loving
3 but
3 she
6 judged
4 that
4 this
5 would
2 be
9 construed
4 into
1 a
10 confession
4 that
3 she
3 had
4 been
2 in
3 the
5 wrong
3 and
10 discipline
7 forbade
4 that
2 so
3 she
4 kept
7 silence
3 and
4 went
5 about
3 her
7 affairs
4 with
1 a
8 troubled
5 heart
3 tom
6 sulked
2 in
1 a
6 corner
3 and
7 exalted
3 his
4 woes
2 he
4 knew
4 that
2 in
3 her
5 heart
3 his
4 aunt
3 was
2 on
3 her
5 knees
2 to
3 him
3 and
2 he
3 was
8 morosely
9 gratified
2 by
3 the
13 consciousness
2 of
2 it
2 he
5 would
4 hang
3 out
2 no
7 signals
2 he
5 would
4 take
6 notice
2 of
4 none
2 he
4 knew
4 that
1 a
8 yearning
6 glance
4 fell
4 upon
3 him
3 now
3 and
4 then
7 through
1 a
4 film
2 of
5 tears
3 but
2 he
7 refused
11 recognition
2 of
2 it
2 he
8 pictured
7 himself
5 lying
4 sick
4 unto
5 death
3 and
3 his
4 aunt
7 bending
4 over
3 him
10 beseeching
3 one
6 little
9 forgiving
4 word
3 but
2 he
5 would
4 turn
3 his
4 face
2 to
3 the
4 wall
3 and
3 die
4 with
4 that
4 word
6 unsaid
2 ah
3 how
5 would
3 she
4 feel
4 then
3 and
2 he
8 pictured
7 himself
7 brought
4 home
4 from
3 the
5 river
4 dead
4 with
3 his
5 curls
3 all
3 wet
3 and
3 his
4 sore
5 heart
2 at
4 rest
3 how
3 she
5 would
5 throw
7 herself
4 upon
3 him
3 and
3 how
3 her
5 tears
5 would
4 fall
4 like
4 rain
3 and
3 her
4 lips
4 pray
3 god
2 to
4 give
3 her
4 back
3 her
3 boy
3 and
3 she
5 would
5 never
5 never
5 abuse
3 him
3 any
4 more
3 but
2 he
5 would
3 lie
5 there
4 cold
3 and
5 white
3 and
4 make
2 no
4 sign
1 a
4 poor
6 little
8 sufferer
5 whose
6 griefs
4 were
2 at
2 an
3 end
2 he
2 so
6 worked
4 upon
3 his
8 feelings
4 with
3 the
6 pathos
2 of
5 these
6 dreams
4 that
2 he
3 had
2 to
4 keep
10 swallowing
2 he
3 was
2 so
4 like
2 to
5 choke
3 and
3 his
4 eyes
4 swam
2 in
1 a
4 blur
2 of
5 water
5 which
10 overflowed
4 when
2 he
6 winked
3 and
3 ran
4 down
3 and
8 trickled
4 from
3 the
3 end
2 of
3 his
4 nose
3 and
4 such
1 a
6 luxury
2 to
3 him
3 was
4 this
7 petting
2 of
3 his
7 sorrows
4 that
2 he
5 could
3 not
4 bear
2 to
4 have
3 any
7 worldly
10 cheeriness
2 or
3 any
7 grating
7 delight
7 intrude
4 upon
2 it
2 it
3 was
3 too
6 sacred
3 for
4 such
7 contact
3 and
2 so
9 presently
4 when
3 his
6 cousin
4 mary
6 danced
2 in
3 all
5 alive
4 with
3 the
3 joy
2 of
6 seeing
4 home
5 again
5 after
2 an
3 age
4 long
5 visit
2 of
3 one
4 week
2 to
3 the
7 country
2 he
3 got
2 up
3 and
5 moved
2 in
6 clouds
3 and
8 darkness
3 out
2 at
3 one
4 door
2 as
3 she
7 brought
4 song
3 and
8 sunshine
2 in
2 at
3 the
5 other
2 he
8 wandered
3 far
4 from
3 the
10 accustomed
6 haunts
2 of
4 boys
3 and
6 sought
8 desolate
6 places
4 that
4 were
2 in
7 harmony
4 with
3 his
6 spirit
1 a
3 log
4 raft
2 in
3 the
5 river
7 invited
3 him
3 and
2 he
6 seated
7 himself
2 on
3 its
5 outer
4 edge
3 and
12 contemplated
3 the
6 dreary
8 vastness
2 of
3 the
6 stream
7 wishing
3 the
5 while
4 that
2 he
5 could
4 only
2 be
7 drowned
3 all
2 at
4 once
3 and
13 unconsciously
7 without
10 undergoing
3 the
13 uncomfortable
7 routine
7 devised
2 by
6 nature
4 then
2 he
7 thought
2 of
3 his
6 flower
2 he
3 got
2 it
3 out
7 rumpled
3 and
6 wilted
3 and
2 it
8 mightily
9 increased
3 his
6 dismal
8 felicity
2 he
8 wondered
2 if
3 she
5 would
4 pity
3 him
2 if
3 she
4 knew
5 would
3 she
3 cry
3 and
4 wish
4 that
3 she
3 had
1 a
5 right
2 to
3 put
3 her
4 arms
6 around
3 his
4 neck
3 and
7 comfort
3 him
2 or
5 would
3 she
4 turn
6 coldly
4 away
4 like
3 all
3 the
6 hollow
5 world
4 this
7 picture
7 brought
4 such
2 an
5 agony
2 of
11 pleasurable
9 suffering
4 that
2 he
6 worked
2 it
4 over
3 and
4 over
5 again
2 in
3 his
4 mind
3 and
3 set
2 it
2 up
2 in
3 new
3 and
6 varied
6 lights
4 till
2 he
4 wore
2 it
10 threadbare
2 at
4 last
2 he
4 rose
2 up
7 sighing
3 and
8 departed
2 in
3 the
8 darkness
5 about
4 half
4 past
4 nine
2 or
3 ten
1 o
5 clock
2 he
4 came
5 along
3 the
8 deserted
6 street
2 to
5 where
3 the
6 adored
7 unknown
5 lived
2 he
6 paused
1 a
6 moment
2 no
5 sound
4 fell
4 upon
3 his
9 listening
3 ear
1 a
6 candle
3 was
7 casting
1 a
4 dull
4 glow
4 upon
3 the
7 curtain
2 of
1 a
6 second
5 story
6 window
3 was
3 the
6 sacred
8 presence
5 there
2 he
7 climbed
3 the
5 fence
8 threaded
3 his
8 stealthy
3 way
7 through
3 the
6 plants
4 till
2 he
5 stood
5 under
4 that
6 window
2 he
6 looked
2 up
2 at
2 it
4 long
3 and
4 with
7 emotion
4 then
2 he
4 laid
3 him
4 down
2 on
3 the
6 ground
5 under
2 it
9 disposing
7 himself
4 upon
3 his
4 back
4 with
3 his
5 hands
7 clasped
4 upon
3 his
6 breast
3 and
7 holding
3 his
4 poor
6 wilted
6 flower
3 and
4 thus
2 he
5 would
3 die
3 out
2 in
3 the
4 cold
5 world
4 with
2 no
7 shelter
4 over
3 his
8 homeless
4 head
2 no
8 friendly
4 hand
2 to
4 wipe
3 the
5 death
5 damps
4 from
3 his
4 brow
2 no
6 loving
4 face
2 to
4 bend
9 pityingly
4 over
3 him
4 when
3 the
5 great
5 agony
4 came
3 and
4 thus
3 she
5 would
3 see
3 him
4 when
3 she
6 looked
3 out
4 upon
3 the
4 glad
7 morning
3 and
2 oh
5 would
3 she
4 drop
3 one
6 little
4 tear
4 upon
3 his
4 poor
8 lifeless
4 form
5 would
3 she
5 heave
3 one
6 little
4 sigh
2 to
3 see
1 a
6 bright
5 young
4 life
2 so
6 rudely
8 blighted
2 so
8 untimely
3 cut
4 down
3 the
6 window
4 went
2 up
1 a
4 maid
7 servant
1 s
10 discordant
5 voice
8 profaned
3 the
4 holy
4 calm
3 and
1 a
6 deluge
2 of
5 water
8 drenched
3 the
5 prone
6 martyr
1 s
7 remains
3 the
10 strangling
4 hero
6 sprang
2 up
4 with
1 a
9 relieving
5 snort
5 there
3 was
1 a
4 whiz
2 as
2 of
1 a
7 missile
2 in
3 the
3 air
7 mingled
4 with
3 the
6 murmur
2 of
1 a
5 curse
1 a
5 sound
2 as
2 of
9 shivering
5 glass
8 followed
3 and
1 a
5 small
5 vague
4 form
4 went
4 over
3 the
5 fence
3 and
4 shot
4 away
2 in
3 the
5 gloom
3 not
4 long
5 after
2 as
3 tom
3 all
9 undressed
3 for
3 bed
3 was
9 surveying
3 his
8 drenched
8 garments
2 by
3 the
5 light
2 of
1 a
6 tallow
3 dip
3 sid
4 woke
2 up
3 but
2 if
2 he
3 had
3 any
3 dim
4 idea
2 of
6 making
3 any
10 references
2 to
9 allusions
2 he
7 thought
6 better
2 of
2 it
3 and
4 held
3 his
5 peace
3 for
5 there
3 was
6 danger
2 in
3 tom
1 s
3 eye
3 tom
6 turned
2 in
7 without
3 the
5 added
8 vexation
2 of
7 prayers
3 and
3 sid
4 made
6 mental
4 note
2 of
3 the
8 omission
7 chapter
2 iv
3 the
3 sun
4 rose
4 upon
1 a
8 tranquil
5 world
3 and
6 beamed
4 down
4 upon
3 the
8 peaceful
7 village
4 like
1 a
11 benediction
9 breakfast
4 over
4 aunt
5 polly
3 had
6 family
7 worship
2 it
5 began
4 with
1 a
6 prayer
5 built
4 from
3 the
6 ground
2 up
2 of
5 solid
7 courses
2 of
10 scriptural
10 quotations
6 welded
8 together
4 with
1 a
4 thin
6 mortar
2 of
11 originality
3 and
4 from
3 the
6 summit
2 of
4 this
3 she
9 delivered
1 a
4 grim
7 chapter
2 of
3 the
6 mosaic
3 law
2 as
4 from
5 sinai
4 then
3 tom
6 girded
2 up
3 his
5 loins
2 so
2 to
5 speak
3 and
4 went
2 to
4 work
2 to
3 get
3 his
6 verses
3 sid
3 had
7 learned
3 his
6 lesson
4 days
6 before
3 tom
4 bent
3 all
3 his
8 energies
2 to
3 the
10 memorizing
2 of
4 five
6 verses
3 and
2 he
5 chose
4 part
2 of
3 the
6 sermon
2 on
3 the
5 mount
7 because
2 he
5 could
4 find
2 no
6 verses
4 that
4 were
7 shorter
2 at
3 the
3 end
2 of
4 half
2 an
4 hour
3 tom
3 had
1 a
5 vague
7 general
4 idea
2 of
3 his
6 lesson
3 but
2 no
4 more
3 for
3 his
4 mind
3 was
10 traversing
3 the
5 whole
5 field
2 of
5 human
7 thought
3 and
3 his
5 hands
4 were
4 busy
4 with
11 distracting
11 recreations
4 mary
4 took
3 his
4 book
2 to
4 hear
3 him
6 recite
3 and
2 he
5 tried
2 to

3 and
2 he
3 did
6 tackle
2 it
5 again
3 and
5 under
3 the
6 double
8 pressure
2 of
9 curiosity
3 and
11 prospective
4 gain
2 he
3 did
2 it
4 with
4 such
6 spirit
4 that
2 he
12 accomplished
1 a
7 shining
7 success
4 mary
4 gave
3 him
1 a
5 brand
3 new
6 barlow
5 knife
5 worth
6 twelve
3 and
1 a
4 half
5 cents
3 and
3 the
10 convulsion
2 of
7 delight
4 that
5 swept
3 his
6 system
5 shook
3 him
2 to
3 his
11 foundations
4 true
3 the
5 knife
5 would
3 not
3 cut
8 anything
3 but
2 it
3 was
1 a
4 sure
6 enough
6 barlow
3 and
5 there
3 was
13 inconceivable
8 grandeur
2 in
4 that
6 though
5 where
3 the
7 western
4 boys
4 ever
3 got
3 the
4 idea
4 that
4 such
1 a
6 weapon
5 could
8 possibly
2 be
13 counterfeited
2 to
3 its
6 injury
2 is
2 an
8 imposing
7 mystery
3 and
4 will
6 always
6 remain
2 so
7 perhaps
3 tom
9 contrived
2 to
7 scarify
3 the
8 cupboard
4 with
2 it
3 and
3 was
9 arranging
2 to
5 begin
2 on
3 the
6 bureau
4 when
2 he
3 was
6 called
3 off
2 to
5 dress
3 for
6 sunday
6 school
4 mary
4 gave
3 him
1 a
3 tin
5 basin
2 of
5 water
3 and
1 a
5 piece
2 of
4 soap
3 and
2 he
4 went
7 outside
3 the
4 door
3 and
3 set
3 the
5 basin
2 on
1 a
6 little
5 bench
5 there
4 then
2 he
6 dipped
3 the
4 soap
2 in
3 the
5 water
3 and
4 laid
2 it
4 down
6 turned
2 up
3 his
7 sleeves
6 poured
3 out
3 the
5 water
2 on
3 the
6 ground
6 gently
3 and
4 then
7 entered
3 the
7 kitchen
3 and
5 began
2 to
4 wipe
3 his
4 face
10 diligently
2 on
3 the
5 towel
6 behind
3 the
4 door
3 but
4 mary
7 removed
3 the
5 towel
3 and
4 said
3 now
3 ain
1 t
3 you
7 ashamed
3 tom
3 you
5 mustn
1 t
2 be
2 so
3 bad
5 water
3 won
1 t
4 hurt
3 you
3 tom
3 was
1 a
6 trifle
12 disconcerted
3 the
5 basin
3 was
8 refilled
3 and
4 this
4 time
2 he
5 stood
4 over
2 it
1 a
6 little
5 while
9 gathering
10 resolution
4 took
2 in
1 a
3 big
6 breath
3 and
5 began
4 when
2 he
7 entered
3 the
7 kitchen
9 presently
4 with
4 both
4 eyes
4 shut
3 and
7 groping
3 for
3 the
5 towel
4 with
3 his
5 hands
2 an
9 honorable
9 testimony
2 of
4 suds
3 and
5 water
3 was
8 dripping
4 from
3 his
4 face
3 but
4 when
2 he
7 emerged
4 from
3 the
5 towel
2 he
3 was
3 not
3 yet
12 satisfactory
3 for
3 the
5 clean
9 territory
7 stopped
5 short
2 at
3 his
4 chin
3 and
3 his
4 jaws
4 like
1 a
4 mask
5 below
3 and
6 beyond
4 this
4 line
5 there
3 was
1 a
4 dark
7 expanse
2 of
11 unirrigated
4 soil
4 that
6 spread
8 downward
2 in
5 front
3 and
8 backward
6 around
3 his
4 neck
4 mary
4 took
3 him
2 in
4 hand
3 and
4 when
3 she
3 was
4 done
4 with
3 him
2 he
3 was
1 a
3 man
3 and
1 a
7 brother
7 without
11 distinction
2 of
5 color
3 and
3 his
9 saturated
4 hair
3 was
6 neatly
7 brushed
3 and
3 its
5 short
5 curls
7 wrought
4 into
1 a
6 dainty
3 and
11 symmetrical
7 general
6 effect
2 he
9 privately
8 smoothed
3 out
3 the
5 curls
4 with
5 labor
3 and
10 difficulty
3 and
9 plastered
3 his
4 hair
5 close
4 down
2 to
3 his
4 head
3 for
2 he
4 held
5 curls
2 to
2 be
10 effeminate
3 and
3 his
3 own
6 filled
3 his
4 life
4 with
10 bitterness
4 then
4 mary
3 got
3 out
1 a
4 suit
2 of
3 his
8 clothing
4 that
3 had
4 been
4 used
4 only
2 on
7 sundays
6 during
3 two
5 years
4 they
4 were
6 simply
6 called
3 his
5 other
7 clothes
3 and
2 so
2 by
4 that
2 we
4 know
3 the
4 size
2 of
3 his
8 wardrobe
3 the
4 girl
3 put
3 him
2 to
6 rights
5 after
2 he
3 had
7 dressed
7 himself
3 she
8 buttoned
3 his
4 neat
10 roundabout
2 up
2 to
3 his
4 chin
6 turned
3 his
4 vast
5 shirt
6 collar
4 down
4 over
3 his
9 shoulders
7 brushed
3 him
3 off
3 and
7 crowned
3 him
4 with
3 his
8 speckled
5 straw
3 hat
2 he
3 now
6 looked
11 exceedingly
8 improved
3 and
13 uncomfortable
2 he
3 was
5 fully
2 as
13 uncomfortable
2 as
2 he
6 looked
3 for
5 there
3 was
1 a
9 restraint
5 about
5 whole
7 clothes
3 and
11 cleanliness
4 that
6 galled
3 him
2 he
5 hoped
4 that
4 mary
5 would
6 forget
3 his
5 shoes
3 but
3 the
4 hope
3 was
8 blighted
3 she
6 coated
4 them
10 thoroughly
4 with
6 tallow
2 as
3 was
3 the
6 custom
3 and
7 brought
4 them
3 out
2 he
4 lost
3 his
6 temper
3 and
4 said
2 he
3 was
6 always
5 being
4 made
2 to
2 do
10 everything
2 he
4 didn
1 t
4 want
2 to
2 do
3 but
4 mary
4 said
12 persuasively
6 please
3 tom
4 that
1 s
1 a
4 good
3 boy
2 so
2 he
3 got
4 into
3 the
5 shoes
8 snarling
4 mary
3 was
4 soon
5 ready
3 and
3 the
5 three
8 children
3 set
3 out
3 for
6 sunday
6 school
1 a
5 place
4 that
3 tom
5 hated
4 with
3 his
5 whole
5 heart
3 but
3 sid

4 mary
4 were
4 fond
2 of
2 it
7 sabbath
6 school
5 hours
4 were

2 of

3 the
5 other

8 remained
3 too
3 for
8 stronger
7 reasons
3 the

4 pews
5 would
4 seat
5 about
5 three
7 hundred
7 persons
3 the
7 edifice
3 was
3 but
1 a
5 small
5 plain
6 affair

1 a

2 of
4 pine
5 board
4 tree

7 plainly
5 bound
5 bible
5 worth
5 forty
5 cents
2 in
5 those
4 easy
5 times
2 to
3 the

3 how
4 many

3 and
11 application
2 to

3 two
8 thousand

6 bibles
2 in
4 this
3 way
2 it
3 was
3 the
7 patient
4 work
2 of
3 two
5 years
3 and
1 a
3 boy
2 of
6 german
9 parentage
3 had
3 won
4 four
2 or
4 five
2 he
4 once
7 recited
5 three
8 thousand
6 verses
7 without
8 stopping
3 but
3 the
6 strain
4 upon
3 his
6 mental
9 faculties
3 was
3 too
5 great
3 and
2 he
3 was
6 little
6 better
4 than
2 an
5 idiot
4 from
4 that
3 day
5 forth
1 a
8 grievous
10 misfortune
3 for
3 the
6 school
3 for
2 on
5 great
9 occasions
6 before
7 company
3 the
14 superintendent
2 as
3 tom
9 expressed
2 it
3 had
6 always
4 made
4 this
3 boy
4 come
3 out
3 and
6 spread
7 himself
4 only
3 the
5 older
6 pupils
7 managed
2 to
4 keep
5 their
7 tickets
3 and
5 stick
2 to
5 their
7 tedious
4 work
4 long
6 enough
2 to
3 get
1 a
5 bible
3 and
2 so
3 the
8 delivery
2 of
3 one
2 of
5 these
6 prizes
3 was
1 a
4 rare
3 and
10 noteworthy
12 circumstance
3 the
10 successful
5 pupil
3 was
2 so
5 great
3 and
11 conspicuous
3 for
4 that
3 day
4 that
2 on
3 the
4 spot
5 every
7 scholar
1 s
5 heart
3 was
5 fired
4 with
1 a
5 fresh
8 ambition
4 that
5 often
6 lasted
1 a
6 couple
2 of
5 weeks
2 it
2 is
8 possible
4 that
3 tom
1 s
6 mental
7 stomach
3 had
5 never
6 really
8 hungered
3 for
3 one
2 of
5 those
6 prizes
3 but
14 unquestionably
3 his
6 entire
5 being
3 had
3 for
4 many
1 a
3 day
6 longed
3 for
3 the
5 glory
3 and
3 the
5 eclat
4 that
4 came
4 with
2 it
2 in
3 due
6 course
3 the
14 superintendent
5 stood
2 up
2 in
5 front
2 of
3 the
6 pulpit
4 with
1 a
6 closed
4 hymn
4 book
2 in
3 his
4 hand
3 and
3 his
10 forefinger
8 inserted
7 between
3 its
6 leaves
3 and
9 commanded
9 attention
4 when
1 a
6 sunday
6 school
14 superintendent
5 makes
3 his
9 customary
6 little
6 speech
1 a
4 hymn
4 book
2 in
3 the
4 hand
2 is
2 as
9 necessary
2 as
2 is
3 the
10 inevitable
5 sheet
2 of
5 music
2 in
3 the
4 hand
2 of
1 a
6 singer
3 who
6 stands
7 forward
2 on
3 the
8 platform
3 and
5 sings
1 a
4 solo
2 at
1 a
7 concert
6 though
3 why
2 is
1 a
7 mystery
3 for
7 neither
3 the
4 hymn
4 book
3 nor
3 the
5 sheet
2 of
5 music
2 is
4 ever
8 referred
2 to

4 five
4 with
1 a
5 sandy
6 goatee
3 and
5 short
5 sandy
4 hair

4 wore
1 a
5 stiff
8 standing
6 collar
5 whose
5 upper
4 edge
6 almost
7 reached
3 his
4 ears
3 and
5 whose
5 sharp
6 points
6 curved
7 forward
7 abreast
3 the
7 corners
2 of
3 his
5 mouth
1 a
5 fence
4 that
9 compelled
1 a
8 straight
7 lookout
5 ahead
3 and
1 a
7 turning
2 of
3 the
5 whole
4 body
4 when
1 a
4 side
4 view
3 was
8 required
3 his
4 chin
3 was
7 propped
2 on
1 a
9 spreading
6 cravat
5 which
3 was
2 as

9 patiently
3 and
11 laboriously
8 produced
2 by

3 was
4 very
7 earnest
2 of

3 and
4 very
7 sincere
3 and
6 honest
2 at

3 and
2 he
4 held
6 sacred
6 things
3 and
6 places
2 in
4 such
9 reverence
3 and
2 so
9 separated
4 them
4 from
7 worldly
7 matters
4 that
13 unconsciously
2 to
7 himself
3 his
6 sunday
6 school
5 voice
3 had
8 acquired
1 a
8 peculiar
10 intonation
5 which

4 many
6 bright

3 and
2 so
5 forth
3 and
2 so
2 on

2 is
3 not
9 necessary
2 to
3 set
4 down
3 the
4 rest
2 of
3 the
7 oration
2 it
3 was
2 of
1 a
7 pattern
5 which
4 does
3 not
4 vary
3 and
2 so
2 it
2 is
8 familiar
2 to
2 us
3 all
3 the
6 latter
5 third
2 of
3 the
6 speech
3 was
6 marred
2 by
3 the
10 resumption
2 of
6 fights
3 and
5 other
11 recreations
5 among
7 certain
2 of
3 the
3 bad
4 boys
3 and
2 by
10 fidgetings
3 and
11 whisperings
4 that
8 extended
3 far
3 and
4 wide
7 washing
4 even
2 to
3 the
5 bases
2 of
8 isolated
3 and
13 incorruptible
5 rocks
4 like
3 sid
3 and
4 mary
3 but
3 now
5 every
5 sound
6 ceased
8 suddenly
4 with
3 the
10 subsidence
2 of
2 mr
7 walters
5 voice
3 and
3 the
10 conclusion
2 of
3 the
6 speech
3 was
8 received
4 with
1 a
5 burst
2 of
6 silent
9 gratitude
1 a
4 good
4 part
2 of
3 the
10 whispering
3 had
4 been
10 occasioned
2 by
2 an
5 event
5 which
3 was
4 more
2 or
4 less
4 rare
3 the
8 entrance
2 of
8 visitors
6 lawyer
8 thatcher
11 accompanied
2 by
1 a
4 very
6 feeble
3 and
4 aged

6 portly
6 middle
4 aged
9 gentleman
4 with

3 the
4 lady
3 was
7 leading

4 when

3 saw
4 this

3 new
5 comer
3 his

3 was
3 all
6 ablaze
4 with
5 bliss
2 in
1 a
6 moment
3 the

6 moment
2 he
3 was
7 showing
3 off
4 with
3 all
3 his
5 might
7 cuffing
4 boys
7 pulling
4 hair
6 making
5 faces
2 in
1 a
4 word
5 using
5 every
3 art
4 that
6 seemed
6 likely
2 to
9 fascinate
1 a
4 girl
3 and
3 win
3 her
8 applause
3 his
10 exaltation
3 had
3 but
3 one
5 alloy
3 the
6 memory
2 of
3 his
11 humiliation
2 in
4 this
5 angel
1 s
6 garden
3 and
4 that
6 record
2 in
4 sand
3 was
4 fast
7 washing
3 out
5 under
3 the
5 waves
2 of
9 happiness
4 that
4 were
8 sweeping
4 over

3 now
3 the

5 these
8 children

8 wondered
4 what
4 kind
2 of
8 material
2 he
3 was
4 made
2 of
3 and
4 they
4 half
6 wanted
2 to

5 which
3 was
4 said
2 to
4 have
1 a
3 tin
4 roof
3 the
3 awe
5 which
5 these
11 reflections
8 inspired
3 was
8 attested
2 by

3 but
5 there
3 was

2 it
4 here
4 were
3 the
9 certified
6 checks
3 and
4 they
4 were
4 good
3 for
5 their
4 face
3 tom
3 was
9 therefore
8 elevated
2 to
1 a
5 place
4 with
3 the
5 judge
3 and
3 the
5 other
5 elect
3 and
3 the
5 great
4 news
3 was
9 announced
4 from
12 headquarters
2 it
3 was
3 the
4 most
8 stunning
8 surprise
2 of
3 the
6 decade
3 and
2 so
8 profound
3 was
3 the
9 sensation
4 that
2 it
6 lifted
3 the
3 new
4 hero
2 up
2 to
3 the
8 judicial
3 one
1 s
8 altitude
3 and
3 the
6 school
3 had
3 two
7 marvels
2 to
4 gaze
4 upon
2 in
5 place
2 of
3 one
3 the
4 boys
4 were
3 all
5 eaten
2 up
4 with
4 envy
3 but
5 those
4 that
8 suffered
3 the
9 bitterest
5 pangs
4 were
5 those
3 who
9 perceived
3 too
4 late
4 that
4 they
10 themselves
3 had
11 contributed
2 to
4 this
5 hated
8 splendor
2 by
7 trading
7 tickets
2 to
3 tom
3 for
3 the
6 wealth
2 he
3 had
7 amassed
2 in
7 selling
12 whitewashing
10 privileges
5 these
8 despised
10 themselves
2 as
5 being
3 the
5 dupes
2 of
1 a
4 wily
5 fraud
1 a
8 guileful
5 snake
2 in
3 the
5 grass
3 the
5 prize
3 was
9 delivered
2 to
3 tom
4 with
2 as
4 much
8 effusion
2 as
3 the
14 superintendent
5 could
4 pump
2 up
5 under
3 the
13 circumstances
3 but
2 it
6 lacked
8 somewhat
2 of
3 the
4 true
4 gush
3 for
3 the
4 poor
6 fellow
1 s
8 instinct
6 taught
3 him
4 that
5 there
3 was
1 a
7 mystery
4 here
4 that
5 could
3 not
4 well
4 bear
3 the
5 light
7 perhaps
2 it
3 was
6 simply
12 preposterous
4 that
4 this
3 boy
3 had
10 warehoused
3 two
8 thousand
7 sheaves
2 of
10 scriptural
6 wisdom
2 on
3 his
8 premises
1 a
5 dozen
5 would
6 strain
3 his
8 capacity
7 without
1 a
5 doubt
3 amy
8 lawrence
3 was
5 proud
3 and
4 glad
3 and
3 she
5 tried
2 to
4 make
3 tom
3 see
2 it
2 in
3 her
4 face
3 but
2 he
6 wouldn
1 t
4 look
3 she
8 wondered
4 then
3 she
3 was
4 just
1 a
5 grain
8 troubled
4 next
1 a
3 dim
9 suspicion
4 came
3 and
4 went
4 came
5 again
3 she
7 watched
1 a
7 furtive
6 glance
4 told
3 her
6 worlds
3 and
4 then
3 her
5 heart
5 broke
3 and
3 she
3 was
7 jealous
3 and
5 angry
3 and
3 the
5 tears
4 came
3 and
3 she
5 hated
9 everybody
3 tom
4 most
2 of
3 all
3 she
7 thought
3 tom
3 was
10 introduced
2 to
3 the
5 judge
3 but
3 his
6 tongue
3 was
4 tied
3 his
6 breath
5 would
6 hardly
4 come
3 his
5 heart
6 quaked
6 partly
7 because
2 of
3 the
5 awful
9 greatness
2 of
3 the
3 man
3 but
6 mainly
7 because
2 he
3 was
3 her
6 parent
2 he
5 would
4 have
5 liked
2 to
4 fall
4 down
3 and
7 worship
3 him
2 if
2 it
4 were
2 in
3 the
4 dark
3 the
5 judge
3 put
3 his
4 hand
2 on
3 tom
1 s
4 head
3 and
6 called
3 him
1 a
4 fine
6 little
3 man
3 and
5 asked
3 him
4 what
3 his
4 name
3 was

4 much
3 his

1 a

5 choir
4 that
3 was
3 not
3 ill
4 bred
3 but
1 i
4 have
9 forgotten
5 where
2 it
3 was
3 now
2 it
3 was
1 a
5 great
4 many
5 years
3 ago
3 and
1 i
3 can
8 scarcely
8 remember
8 anything
5 about
2 it
3 but
1 i
5 think
2 it
3 was
2 in
4 some
7 foreign
7 country
3 the
8 minister
4 gave
3 out
3 the
4 hymn
3 and
4 read
2 it
7 through
4 with
1 a
6 relish
2 in
1 a

5 style
5 which
3 was
4 much
7 admired
2 in
4 that
4 part
2 of
3 the

3 his

5 began
2 on
1 a

3 key
3 and
7 climbed
8 steadily
2 up
4 till
2 it
7 reached
1 a
7 certain
5 point
5 where
2 it
4 bore
4 with
6 strong
8 emphasis
4 upon
3 the
7 topmost
4 word
3 and
4 then
7 plunged

4 seas
2 he
3 was
8 regarded
2 as
1 a
9 wonderful
6 reader
2 at
6 church
9 sociables
2 he
3 was
6 always
6 called
4 upon
2 to
4 read
6 poetry
3 and
4 when
2 he
3 was
7 through
3 the
6 ladies
5 would
4 lift
2 up
5 their
5 hands
3 and
3 let
4 them
4 fall
10 helplessly
2 in
5 their
4 laps
3 and
4 wall
5 their

3 and
5 shake
5 their

2 as
4 much
2 as
2 to
3 say
5 words
6 cannot
7 express
2 it
2 it
2 is
3 too
9 beautiful
3 too
9 beautiful
3 for

5 after

3 the

2 mr

6 turned

3 and
4 read
3 off
7 notices
2 of
8 meetings
3 and
9 societies
3 and
6 things
4 till
2 it
6 seemed
4 that
3 the
4 list
5 would
7 stretch
3 out
2 to
3 the
5 crack
2 of
4 doom
1 a
5 queer
6 custom
5 which
2 is
5 still
4 kept
2 up
2 in
7 america
4 even
2 in
6 cities
4 away
4 here
2 in
4 this
3 age
2 of
8 abundant
10 newspapers
5 often
3 the
4 less
5 there
2 is
2 to
7 justify
1 a
11 traditional
6 custom
3 the
6 harder
2 it
2 is
2 to
3 get
3 rid
2 of
2 it
3 and
3 now
3 the
8 minister
6 prayed
1 a
4 good
8 generous
6 prayer
2 it
3 was
3 and
4 went
4 into
7 details
2 it
7 pleaded
3 for

2 of
3 the
3 sea
3 and
6 closed
4 with
1 a
12 supplication
4 that
3 the
5 words
2 he
3 was
5 about
2 to
5 speak
5 might
4 find
5 grace
3 and
5 favor
3 and
2 be
2 as
4 seed

2 in
7 fertile
6 ground
8 yielding
2 in
4 time
1 a
8 grateful
7 harvest
2 of
4 good
4 amen
5 there
3 was
1 a
8 rustling
2 of
7 dresses
3 and
3 the
8 standing
12 congregation
3 sat
4 down
3 the
3 boy
5 whose
7 history
4 this
4 book
7 relates
3 did
3 not
5 enjoy
3 the
6 prayer
2 he
4 only
7 endured
2 it
2 if
2 he
4 even
3 did
4 that
4 much
2 he
3 was
7 restive
3 all
7 through
2 it
2 he
4 kept
5 tally
2 of
3 the
7 details
2 of
3 the
6 prayer
13 unconsciously
3 for
2 he
3 was
3 not
9 listening
3 but
2 he
4 knew
3 the
6 ground
2 of
3 old
3 and
3 the
9 clergyman
1 s
7 regular
5 route
4 over
2 it
3 and
4 when
1 a
6 little
6 trifle
2 of
3 new
6 matter
3 was
11 interlarded
3 his
3 ear
8 detected
2 it
3 and
3 his
5 whole
6 nature
8 resented
2 it
2 he
10 considered
9 additions
6 unfair
3 and
11 scoundrelly
2 in
3 the
5 midst
2 of
3 the
6 prayer
1 a
3 fly
3 had
3 lit
2 on
3 the
4 back
2 of
3 the
3 pew
2 in
5 front
2 of
3 him
3 and
8 tortured
3 his
6 spirit
2 by
6 calmly
7 rubbing
3 its
5 hands
8 together
9 embracing
3 its
4 head
4 with
3 its
4 arms
3 and
9 polishing
2 it
2 so
10 vigorously
4 that
2 it
6 seemed
2 to
6 almost
4 part
7 company
4 with
3 the
4 body
3 and
3 the
7 slender
6 thread
2 of
1 a
4 neck
3 was
7 exposed
2 to
4 view
8 scraping
3 its
5 wings
4 with
3 its
4 hind
4 legs
3 and
9 smoothing
4 them
2 to
3 its
4 body
2 as
2 if
4 they
3 had
4 been
4 coat
5 tails
5 going
7 through
3 its
5 whole
6 toilet
2 as
10 tranquilly
2 as
2 if
2 it
4 knew
2 it
3 was
9 perfectly
4 safe
2 as
6 indeed
2 it
3 was
3 for
2 as
6 sorely
2 as
3 tom
1 s
5 hands
6 itched
2 to
4 grab
3 for
2 it
4 they
3 did
3 not
4 dare
2 he
8 believed
3 his
4 soul
5 would
2 be
9 instantly
9 destroyed
2 if
2 he
3 did
4 such
1 a
5 thing
5 while
3 the
6 prayer
3 was
5 going
2 on
3 but
4 with
3 the
7 closing
8 sentence
3 his
4 hand
5 began
2 to
5 curve
3 and
5 steal
7 forward
3 and
3 the
7 instant
3 the
4 amen
3 was
3 out
3 the
3 fly
3 was
1 a
8 prisoner
2 of
3 war
3 his
4 aunt
8 detected
3 the
3 act
3 and
4 made
3 him
3 let
2 it
2 go
3 the
8 minister
4 gave
3 out
3 his
4 text
3 and
6 droned
5 along
12 monotonously
7 through
2 an
8 argument
4 that
3 was
2 so
5 prosy
4 that
4 many
1 a
4 head
2 by
3 and
2 by
5 began
2 to
3 nod
3 and
3 yet
2 it
3 was
2 an
8 argument
4 that
5 dealt
2 in
9 limitless
4 fire
3 and
9 brimstone
3 and
7 thinned
3 the
11 predestined
5 elect
4 down
2 to
1 a
7 company
2 so
5 small
2 as
2 to
2 be
6 hardly
5 worth
3 the
6 saving
3 tom
7 counted
3 the
5 pages
2 of
3 the
6 sermon
5 after
6 church
2 he
6 always
4 knew
3 how
4 many
5 pages
5 there
3 had
4 been
3 but
2 he
6 seldom
4 knew
8 anything
4 else
5 about
3 the
9 discourse
7 however
4 this
4 time
2 he
3 was
6 really
10 interested
3 for
1 a
6 little
5 while
3 the
8 minister
4 made
1 a
5 grand
3 and
6 moving
7 picture
2 of
3 the
10 assembling
8 together
2 of
3 the
5 world
1 s
5 hosts
2 at
3 the
10 millennium
4 when
3 the
4 lion
3 and
3 the
4 lamb
6 should
3 lie
4 down
8 together
3 and
1 a
6 little
5 child
6 should
4 lead
4 them
3 but
3 the
6 pathos
3 the
6 lesson
3 the
5 moral
2 of
3 the
5 great
9 spectacle
4 were
4 lost
4 upon
3 the
3 boy
2 he
4 only
7 thought
2 of
3 the
15 conspicuousness
2 of
3 the
9 principal
9 character
6 before
3 the
2 on
7 looking
7 nations
3 his
4 face
3 lit
4 with
3 the
7 thought
3 and
2 he
4 said
2 to
7 himself
4 that
2 he
6 wished
2 he
5 could
2 be
4 that
5 child
2 if
2 it
3 was
1 a
4 tame
4 lion
3 now
2 he
6 lapsed
4 into
9 suffering
5 again
2 as
3 the
3 dry
8 argument
3 was
7 resumed
9 presently
2 he
9 bethought
3 him
2 of
1 a
8 treasure
2 he
3 had
3 and
3 got
2 it
3 out
2 it
3 was
1 a
5 large
5 black
6 beetle
4 with
10 formidable
4 jaws
1 a
8 pinchbug
2 he
6 called
2 it
2 it
3 was
2 in
1 a
10 percussion
3 cap
3 box
3 the
5 first
5 thing
3 the
6 beetle
3 did
3 was
2 to
4 take
3 him
2 by
3 the
6 finger
1 a
7 natural
6 fillip
8 followed
3 the
6 beetle
4 went
11 floundering
4 into
3 the
5 aisle
3 and
3 lit
2 on
3 its
4 back
3 and
3 the
4 hurt
6 finger
4 went
4 into
3 the
3 boy
1 s
5 mouth
3 the
6 beetle
3 lay
5 there
7 working
3 its
8 helpless
4 legs
6 unable
2 to
4 turn
4 over
3 tom
4 eyed
2 it
3 and
6 longed
3 for
2 it
3 but
2 it
3 was
4 safe
3 out
2 of
3 his
5 reach
5 other
6 people
12 uninterested
2 in
3 the
6 sermon
5 found
6 relief
2 in
3 the
6 beetle
3 and
4 they
4 eyed
2 it
3 too
9 presently
1 a
7 vagrant
6 poodle
3 dog
4 came
6 idling
5 along
3 sad
2 at
5 heart
4 lazy
4 with
3 the
6 summer
8 softness
3 and
3 the
5 quiet
5 weary
2 of
9 captivity
7 sighing
3 for
6 change
2 he
5 spied
3 the
6 beetle
3 the
8 drooping
4 tail
6 lifted
3 and
6 wagged
2 he
8 surveyed
3 the
5 prize
6 walked
6 around
2 it
5 smelt
2 at
2 it
4 from
1 a
4 safe
8 distance
6 walked
6 around
2 it
5 again
4 grew
6 bolder
3 and
4 took
1 a
6 closer
5 smell
4 then
6 lifted
3 his
3 lip
3 and
4 made
1 a
8 gingerly
6 snatch
2 at
2 it
4 just
7 missing
2 it
4 made
7 another
3 and
7 another
5 began
2 to
5 enjoy
3 the
9 diversion
8 subsided
2 to
3 his
7 stomach
4 with
3 the
6 beetle
7 between
3 his
4 paws
3 and
9 continued
3 his
11 experiments
4 grew
5 weary
2 at
4 last
3 and
4 then
11 indifferent
3 and
6 absent
6 minded
3 his
4 head
6 nodded
3 and
6 little
2 by
6 little
3 his
4 chin
9 descended
3 and
7 touched
3 the
5 enemy
3 who
6 seized
2 it
5 there
3 was
1 a
5 sharp
4 yelp
1 a
5 flirt
2 of
3 the
6 poodle
1 s
4 head
3 and
3 the
6 beetle
4 fell
1 a
6 couple
2 of
5 yards
4 away
3 and
3 lit
2 on
3 its
4 back
4 once
4 more
3 the
11 neighboring
10 spectators
5 shook
4 with
1 a
6 gentle
6 inward
3 joy
7 several
5 faces
4 went
6 behind
4 fans
3 and
13 handkerchiefs
3 and
3 tom
3 was
8 entirely
5 happy
3 the
3 dog
6 looked
7 foolish
3 and
8 probably
4 felt
2 so
3 but
5 there
3 was
10 resentment
2 in
3 his
5 heart
3 too
3 and
1 a
7 craving
3 for
7 revenge
2 so
2 he
4 went
2 to
3 the
6 beetle
3 and
5 began
1 a
4 wary
6 attack
2 on
2 it
5 again
7 jumping
2 at
2 it
4 from
5 every
5 point
2 of
1 a
6 circle
8 lighting
4 with
3 his
4 fore
4 paws
6 within
2 an
4 inch
2 of
3 the
8 creature
6 making
4 even
6 closer
8 snatches
2 at
2 it
4 with
3 his
5 teeth
3 and
7 jerking
3 his
4 head
4 till
3 his
4 ears
7 flapped
5 again
3 but
2 he
4 grew
5 tired
4 once
4 more
5 after
1 a
5 while
5 tried
2 to
5 amuse
7 himself
4 with
1 a
3 fly
3 but
5 found
2 no
6 relief
8 followed
2 an
3 ant
6 around
4 with
3 his
4 nose
5 close
2 to
3 the
5 floor
3 and
7 quickly
7 wearied
2 of
4 that
6 yawned
6 sighed
6 forgot
3 the
6 beetle
8 entirely
3 and
3 sat
4 down
2 on
2 it
4 then
5 there
3 was
1 a
4 wild
4 yelp
2 of
5 agony
3 and
3 the
6 poodle
4 went
7 sailing
2 up
3 the
5 aisle
3 the
5 yelps
9 continued
3 and
2 so
3 did
3 the
3 dog
2 he
7 crossed
3 the
5 house
2 in
5 front
2 of
3 the
5 altar
2 he
4 flew
4 down
3 the
5 other
5 aisle
2 he
7 crossed
6 before
3 the
5 doors
2 he
8 clamored
2 up
3 the
4 home
7 stretch
3 his
7 anguish
4 grew
4 with
3 his
8 progress
4 till
9 presently
2 he
3 was
3 but
1 a
6 woolly
5 comet
6 moving
2 in
3 its
5 orbit
4 with
3 the
5 gleam
3 and
3 the
5 speed
2 of
5 light
2 at
4 last
3 the
7 frantic
8 sufferer
7 sheered
4 from
3 its
6 course
3 and
6 sprang
4 into
3 its
6 master
1 s
3 lap
2 he
5 flung
2 it
3 out
2 of
3 the
6 window
3 and
3 the
5 voice
2 of
8 distress
7 quickly
7 thinned
4 away
3 and
4 died
2 in
3 the
8 distance
2 by
4 this
4 time
3 the
5 whole
6 church
3 was
3 red
5 faced
3 and
11 suffocating
4 with
10 suppressed
8 laughter
3 and
3 the
6 sermon
3 had
4 come
2 to
1 a
4 dead
10 standstill
3 the
9 discourse
3 was
7 resumed
9 presently
3 but
2 it
4 went
4 lame
3 and
7 halting
3 all
11 possibility
2 of
14 impressiveness
5 being
2 at
2 an
3 end
3 for
4 even
3 the
7 gravest
10 sentiments
4 were
10 constantly
5 being
8 received
4 with
1 a
9 smothered
5 burst
2 of
6 unholy
5 mirth
5 under
5 cover
2 of
4 some
6 remote
3 pew
4 back
2 as
2 if
3 the
4 poor
6 parson
3 had
4 said
1 a
6 rarely
9 facetious
5 thing
2 it
3 was
1 a
7 genuine
6 relief
2 to
3 the
5 whole
12 congregation
4 when
3 the
6 ordeal
3 was
4 over
3 and
3 the
11 benediction
10 pronounced
3 tom
6 sawyer
4 went
4 home
5 quite
8 cheerful
8 thinking
2 to
7 himself
4 that
5 there
3 was
4 some
12 satisfaction
5 about
6 divine
7 service
4 when
5 there
3 was
1 a
3 bit
2 of
7 variety
2 in
2 it
2 he
3 had
3 but
3 one
7 marring
7 thought
2 he
3 was
7 willing
4 that
3 the
3 dog
6 should
4 play
4 with
3 his
8 pinchbug
3 but
2 he
3 did
3 not
5 think
2 it
3 was
7 upright
2 in
3 him
2 to
5 carry
2 it
3 off
7 chapter
2 vi
6 monday
7 morning
5 found
3 tom
6 sawyer
9 miserable
6 monday
7 morning
6 always
5 found
3 him
2 so
7 because
2 it
5 began
7 another
4 week
1 s
4 slow
9 suffering
2 in
6 school
2 he
9 generally
5 began
4 that
3 day
4 with
7 wishing
2 he
3 had
3 had
2 no
11 intervening
7 holiday
2 it
4 made
3 the
5 going
4 into
9 captivity
3 and
7 fetters
5 again
2 so
4 much
4 more
6 odious
3 tom
3 lay
8 thinking
9 presently
2 it
8 occurred
2 to
3 him
4 that
2 he
6 wished
2 he
3 was
4 sick
4 then
2 he
5 could
4 stay
4 home
4 from
6 school
4 here
3 was
1 a
5 vague
11 possibility
2 he
9 canvassed
3 his
6 system
2 no
7 ailment
3 was
5 found
3 and
2 he
12 investigated
5 again
4 this
4 time
2 he
7 thought
2 he
5 could
6 detect
7 colicky
8 symptoms
3 and
2 he
5 began
2 to
9 encourage
4 them
4 with
12 considerable
4 hope
3 but
4 they
4 soon
4 grew
6 feeble
3 and
9 presently
4 died
6 wholly
4 away
2 he
9 reflected
7 further
8 suddenly
2 he
10 discovered
9 something
3 one
2 of
3 his
5 upper
5 front
5 teeth
3 was
5 loose
4 this
3 was
5 lucky
2 he
3 was
5 about
2 to
5 begin
2 to
5 groan
2 as
1 a
7 starter
2 as
2 he
6 called
2 it
4 when
2 it
8 occurred
2 to
3 him
4 that
2 if
2 he
4 came
4 into
5 court
4 with
4 that
8 argument
3 his
4 aunt
5 would
4 pull
2 it
3 out
3 and
4 that
5 would
4 hurt
2 so
2 he
7 thought
2 he
5 would
4 hold
3 the
5 tooth
2 in
7 reserve
3 for
3 the
7 present
3 and
4 seek
7 further
7 nothing
7 offered
3 for
4 some
6 little
4 time
3 and
4 then
2 he
10 remembered
7 hearing
3 the
6 doctor
4 tell
5 about
1 a
7 certain
5 thing
4 that
4 laid
2 up
1 a
7 patient
3 for
3 two
2 or
5 three
5 weeks
3 and
10 threatened
2 to
4 make
3 him
4 lose
1 a
6 finger
2 so
3 the
3 boy
7 eagerly
4 drew
3 his
4 sore
3 toe
4 from
5 under
3 the
5 sheet
3 and
4 held
2 it
2 up
3 for
10 inspection
3 but
3 now
2 he
3 did
3 not
4 know
3 the
9 necessary
8 symptoms
7 however
2 it
6 seemed
4 well
5 worth
5 while
2 to
6 chance
2 it
2 so
2 he
4 fell
2 to
8 groaning
4 with
12 considerable
6 spirit
3 but
3 sid
5 slept
2 on
11 unconscious
3 tom
7 groaned
6 louder
3 and
7 fancied
4 that
2 he
5 began
2 to
4 feel
4 pain
2 in
3 the
3 toe
2 no
6 result
4 from
3 sid
3 tom
3 was
7 panting
4 with
3 his
9 exertions
2 by
4 this
4 time
2 he
4 took
1 a
4 rest
3 and
4 then
7 swelled
7 himself
2 up
3 and
7 fetched
1 a
10 succession
2 of
9 admirable
6 groans
3 sid
6 snored
2 on
3 tom
3 was
10 aggravated
2 he
4 said
3 sid
3 sid
3 and
5 shook
3 him
4 this
6 course
6 worked
4 well
3 and
3 tom
5 began
2 to
5 groan
5 again
3 sid
6 yawned
9 stretched
4 then
7 brought
7 himself
2 up
2 on
3 his
5 elbow
4 with
1 a
5 snort
3 and
5 began
2 to
5 stare
2 at
3 tom
3 tom
4 went
2 on
8 groaning
3 sid
4 said
3 tom
3 say
3 tom
2 no
8 response

3 tom
3 tom
4 what

3 the

2 he
5 shook
3 him
3 and

1 s
5 tooth
4 with

3 now
3 but
3 all

5 bring
5 their

2 as

6 school
5 after
9 breakfast
2 he
3 was
3 the
4 envy
2 of
5 every
3 boy
2 he
3 met
7 because
3 the
3 gap
2 in
3 his
5 upper
3 row
2 of
5 teeth
7 enabled
3 him
2 to
11 expectorate
2 in
1 a
3 new
3 and
9 admirable
3 way
2 he
8 gathered
5 quite
1 a
9 following
2 of
4 lads
10 interested
2 in
3 the
10 exhibition
3 and
3 one
4 that
3 had

4 been
1 a
6 centre
2 of
11 fascination
3 and
6 homage
2 up

7 himself
8 suddenly
7 without
2 an
8 adherent
3 and
5 shorn
2 of
3 his
5 glory
3 his
5 heart
3 was
5 heavy
3 and
2 he
4 said
4 with
1 a
7 disdain
5 which
2 he
3 did
3 not
4 feel
4 that
2 it
4 wasn
1 t
8 anything
2 to
4 spit
4 like
3 tom
6 sawyer
3 but
7 another
3 boy

7 because
2 he
3 was
4 idle
3 and
7 lawless
3 and
6 vulgar
3 and
3 bad
3 and
7 because
3 all
5 their
8 children
7 admired
3 him
2 so
3 and
9 delighted
2 in
3 his
9 forbidden
7 society
3 and

1 s
1 a

10 percussion
3 cap
3 box
4 that
3 had
6 lately
4 been
3 the
8 pinchbug
1 s
6 prison
3 and
3 the
4 boys
9 separated
4 each
7 feeling
9 wealthier
4 than
6 before
4 when
3 tom
7 reached
3 the
6 little
8 isolated
5 frame
11 schoolhouse
2 he
6 strode
2 in
7 briskly
4 with
3 the
6 manner
2 of
3 one
3 who
3 had
4 come
4 with
3 all
6 honest
5 speed
2 he
4 hung
3 his
3 hat
2 on
1 a
3 peg
3 and
5 flung
7 himself
4 into
3 his
4 seat
4 with
8 business
4 like
8 alacrity
3 the
6 master
7 throned
2 on
4 high
2 in
3 his
5 great
6 splint
6 bottom
3 arm
5 chair
3 was
6 dozing
6 lulled
2 by
3 the
6 drowsy
3 hum
2 of
5 study
3 the
12 interruption
6 roused
3 him
6 thomas
6 sawyer
3 tom
4 knew
4 that
4 when
3 his
4 name
3 was
10 pronounced
2 in
4 full
2 it
5 meant
7 trouble
3 sir
4 come
2 up
4 here
3 now
3 sir
3 why
3 are
3 you
4 late
5 again
2 as
5 usual
3 tom
3 was
5 about
2 to
4 take
6 refuge
2 in
1 a
3 lie
4 when
2 he
3 saw
3 two
4 long
5 tails
2 of
6 yellow
4 hair
7 hanging
4 down
1 a
4 back
4 that
2 he
10 recognized
2 by
3 the
8 electric
8 sympathy
2 of
4 love
3 and
2 by
4 that
4 form
3 was
3 the
4 only
6 vacant
5 place
2 on
3 the
5 girls
4 side
2 of
3 the
11 schoolhouse
2 he
9 instantly
4 said
1 i
7 stopped
2 to
4 talk
4 with
11 huckleberry
4 finn
3 the
6 master
1 s
5 pulse
5 stood
5 still
3 and
2 he
6 stared
10 helplessly
3 the
4 buzz
2 of
5 study
6 ceased
3 the
6 pupils
8 wondered
2 if
4 this
9 foolhardy
3 boy
3 had
4 lost
3 his
4 mind
3 the
6 master
4 said
3 you
3 you
3 did
4 what
7 stopped
2 to
4 talk
4 with
11 huckleberry
4 finn
5 there
3 was
2 no
9 mistaking
3 the
5 words
6 thomas
6 sawyer
4 this
2 is
3 the
4 most
10 astounding
10 confession
1 i

2 no
4 mere
6 ferule
4 will
6 answer
3 for
4 this
7 offence
4 take
3 off
4 your
6 jacket
3 the
6 master
1 s
3 arm
9 performed
5 until
2 it
3 was
5 tired
3 and
3 the
5 stock
2 of
8 switches
7 notably
10 diminished
4 then
3 the
5 order
8 followed
3 now
3 sir
2 go
3 and
3 sit
4 with
3 the
5 girls
3 and
3 let
4 this
2 be
1 a
7 warning
2 to
3 you
3 the
6 titter
4 that
7 rippled
6 around
3 the
4 room
8 appeared
2 to
5 abash
3 the
3 boy
3 but
2 in
7 reality
4 that
6 result
3 was
6 caused
6 rather
4 more
2 by
3 his
10 worshipful
3 awe
2 of
3 his
7 unknown
4 idol
3 and
3 the
5 dread
8 pleasure
4 that
3 lay
2 in
3 his
4 high
4 good
7 fortune
2 he
3 sat
4 down
4 upon
3 the
3 end
2 of
3 the
4 pine
5 bench
3 and
3 the
4 girl
7 hitched
7 herself
4 away
4 from
3 him
4 with
1 a
4 toss
2 of
3 her
4 head
6 nudges
3 and
5 winks
3 and
8 whispers
9 traversed
3 the
4 room
3 but
3 tom
3 sat
5 still
4 with
3 his
4 arms
4 upon
3 the
4 long
3 low
4 desk
6 before
3 him
3 and
6 seemed
2 to
5 study
3 his
4 book
2 by
3 and
2 by
9 attention
6 ceased
4 from
3 him
3 and
3 the
10 accustomed
6 school
6 murmur
4 rose
4 upon
3 the
4 dull
3 air
4 once
4 more
9 presently
3 the
3 boy
5 began
2 to
5 steal
7 furtive
7 glances
2 at
3 the
4 girl
3 she
8 observed
2 it
4 made
1 a
5 mouth
2 at
3 him
3 and
4 gave
3 him
3 the
4 back
2 of
3 her
4 head
3 for
3 the
5 space
2 of
1 a
6 minute
4 when
3 she
10 cautiously
5 faced
6 around
5 again
1 a
5 peach
3 lay
6 before
3 her
3 she
6 thrust
2 it
4 away
3 tom
6 gently
3 put
2 it
4 back
3 she
6 thrust
2 it
4 away
5 again
3 but
4 with
4 less
9 animosity
3 tom
9 patiently
8 returned
2 it
2 to
3 its
5 place
4 then
3 she
3 let
2 it
6 remain
3 tom
8 scrawled
2 on
3 his
5 slate
6 please
4 take
2 it
1 i
3 got
4 more
3 the
4 girl
7 glanced
2 at
3 the
5 words
3 but
4 made
2 no
4 sign
3 now
3 the
3 boy
5 began
2 to
4 draw
9 something
2 on
3 the
5 slate
6 hiding
3 his
4 work
4 with
3 his
4 left
4 hand
3 for
1 a
4 time
3 the
4 girl
7 refused
2 to
6 notice
3 but
3 her
5 human
9 curiosity
9 presently
5 began
2 to
8 manifest
6 itself
2 by
6 hardly
11 perceptible
5 signs
3 the
3 boy
6 worked
2 on
10 apparently
11 unconscious
3 the
4 girl
4 made
1 a
4 sort
2 of
12 noncommittal
7 attempt
2 to
3 see
3 but
3 the
3 boy
3 did
3 not
6 betray
4 that
2 he
3 was
5 aware
2 of
2 it
2 at
4 last
3 she
4 gave
2 in
3 and
12 hesitatingly
9 whispered
3 let
2 me
3 see
2 it
3 tom
6 partly
9 uncovered
1 a
6 dismal
10 caricature
2 of
1 a
5 house
4 with
3 two
5 gable
4 ends
2 to
2 it
3 and
1 a
9 corkscrew
2 of
5 smoke
7 issuing
4 from
3 the
7 chimney
4 then
3 the
4 girl
1 s
8 interest
5 began
2 to
6 fasten
6 itself
4 upon
3 the
4 work
3 and
3 she
6 forgot
10 everything
4 else
4 when
2 it
3 was
8 finished
3 she
5 gazed
1 a
6 moment
4 then
9 whispered
2 it
1 s
4 nice
4 make
1 a
3 man
3 the
6 artist
7 erected
1 a
3 man
2 in
3 the
5 front
4 yard
4 that
9 resembled
1 a
7 derrick
2 he
5 could
4 have
7 stepped
4 over
3 the
5 house
3 but
3 the
4 girl
3 was
3 not
13 hypercritical
3 she
3 was
9 satisfied
4 with
3 the
7 monster
3 and
9 whispered
2 it
1 s
1 a
9 beautiful
3 man
3 now

2 me
6 coming
5 along
3 tom
4 drew
2 an
4 hour
5 glass
4 with
1 a
4 full
4 moon
3 and
5 straw
5 limbs
2 to
2 it
3 and
5 armed
3 the
9 spreading
7 fingers
4 with
1 a
10 portentous
3 fan
3 the
4 girl
4 said
2 it

3 tom
5 began
2 to
6 scrawl
9 something
2 on
3 the
5 slate
6 hiding
3 the
5 words
4 from
3 the
4 girl
3 but
3 she
3 was
3 not
8 backward
4 this
4 time
3 she
6 begged

3 and
3 she
3 put
3 her
5 small
4 hand
4 upon
3 his
3 and
1 a
6 little
7 scuffle
6 ensued
3 tom
10 pretending
2 to
6 resist
2 in
7 earnest
3 but
7 letting
3 his
4 hand
4 slip
2 by
7 degrees
4 till
5 these
5 words
4 were
8 revealed
1 i
4 love
3 you
2 oh
3 you
3 bad
5 thing
3 and
3 she
3 hit
3 his
4 hand
1 a
5 smart
3 rap
3 but
8 reddened
3 and
6 looked
7 pleased
12 nevertheless
4 just
2 at
4 this
8 juncture
3 the
3 boy
4 felt
1 a
4 slow
7 fateful
4 grip
7 closing
2 on
3 his
3 ear
3 and
1 a
6 steady
7 lifting
7 impulse
2 in
4 that
4 vise
2 he
3 was
5 borne
6 across
3 the
5 house
3 and
9 deposited
2 in
3 his
3 own
4 seat
5 under
1 a
9 peppering
4 fire
2 of
7 giggles
4 from
3 the
5 whole
6 school
4 then
3 the
6 master
5 stood
4 over
3 him
6 during
1 a
3 few
5 awful
7 moments
3 and
7 finally
5 moved
4 away
2 to
3 his
6 throne
7 without
6 saying
1 a
4 word
3 but
8 although
3 tom
1 s
3 ear
7 tingled
3 his
5 heart
3 was
8 jubilant
2 as
3 the
6 school
7 quieted
4 down
3 tom
4 made
2 an
6 honest
6 effort
2 to
5 study
3 but
3 the
7 turmoil
6 within
3 him
3 was
3 too
5 great
2 in
4 turn
2 he
4 took
3 his
5 place
2 in
3 the
7 reading
5 class
3 and
4 made
1 a
5 botch
2 of
2 it
4 then
2 in
3 the
9 geography
5 class
3 and
6 turned
5 lakes
4 into
9 mountains
9 mountains
4 into
6 rivers
3 and
6 rivers

6 turned
4 down
2 by
1 a
10 succession
2 of
4 mere
4 baby
5 words
4 till
2 he
7 brought
2 up
2 at
3 the
4 foot
3 and
7 yielded
2 up
3 the

3 the

3 his
5 ideas
8 wandered
2 so
2 at
4 last
4 with
1 a
4 sigh
3 and
1 a
4 yawn
2 he
4 gave
2 it
2 up
2 it
6 seemed
2 to
3 him
4 that
3 the
4 noon
6 recess
5 would
5 never
4 come
3 the
3 air
3 was
7 utterly
4 dead
5 there
3 was
3 not
1 a
6 breath
8 stirring
2 it
3 was
3 the
9 sleepiest
2 of
6 sleepy
4 days
3 the
8 drowsing
6 murmur
2 of
3 the
4 five
3 and
6 twenty
8 studying
8 scholars
7 soothed
3 the
4 soul
4 like
3 the
5 spell
4 that
2 is
2 in
3 the
6 murmur
2 of
4 bees
4 away
3 off
2 in
3 the

8 sunshine
7 cardiff
4 hill
6 lifted
3 its
4 soft
5 green
5 sides
7 through
1 a
10 shimmering
4 veil
2 of
4 heat
6 tinted
4 with
3 the
6 purple
2 of
8 distance
1 a
3 few

7 floated
2 on
4 lazy
4 wing
4 high
2 in
3 the
3 air
2 no
5 other
6 living
5 thing
3 was
7 visible
3 but
4 some
4 cows
3 and
4 they
4 were
6 asleep
3 tom
1 s
5 heart
5 ached
2 to
2 be
4 free
2 or
4 else
2 to
4 have
9 something
2 of
8 interest
2 to
2 do
2 to
4 pass
3 the
6 dreary
4 time
3 his
4 hand
8 wandered
4 into
3 his
6 pocket
3 and
3 his
4 face
3 lit
2 up
4 with
1 a
4 glow
2 of
9 gratitude
4 that
3 was
6 prayer
6 though
2 he
3 did
3 not
4 know
2 it
4 then
9 furtively
3 the
10 percussion
3 cap
3 box
4 came
3 out
2 he
8 released
3 the
4 tick
3 and
3 put
3 him
2 on
3 the
4 long
4 flat
4 desk
3 the
8 creature
8 probably
6 glowed
4 with
1 a
9 gratitude
4 that
8 amounted
2 to
6 prayer
3 too
2 at
4 this
6 moment
3 but
2 it
3 was
9 premature
3 for
4 when
2 he
7 started
10 thankfully
2 to
6 travel
3 off
3 tom
6 turned
3 him
5 aside
4 with
1 a
3 pin
3 and
4 made
3 him
4 take
1 a
3 new
9 direction
3 tom
1 s
5 bosom
6 friend
3 sat
4 next
3 him
9 suffering
4 just
2 as
3 tom
3 had
4 been
3 and
3 now
2 he
3 was
6 deeply
3 and
10 gratefully
10 interested
2 in
4 this
13 entertainment
2 in
2 an
7 instant
4 this
5 bosom
6 friend
3 was
3 joe
6 harper
3 the
3 two
4 boys
4 were
5 sworn
7 friends
3 all
3 the
4 week
3 and
9 embattled
7 enemies
2 on
9 saturdays
3 joe
4 took
1 a
3 pin
3 out
2 of
3 his
5 lapel
3 and
5 began
2 to
6 assist
2 in
10 exercising
3 the
8 prisoner
3 the
5 sport
4 grew
2 in
8 interest
8 momently
4 soon
3 tom
4 said
4 that
4 they
4 were
11 interfering
4 with
4 each
5 other
3 and
7 neither
7 getting
3 the
7 fullest
7 benefit
2 of
3 the
4 tick
2 so
2 he
3 put
3 joe
1 s
5 slate
2 on
3 the
4 desk
3 and
4 drew
1 a
4 line
4 down
3 the
6 middle
2 of
2 it
4 from
3 top
2 to
6 bottom
3 now
4 said
2 he
2 as
4 long
2 as
2 he
2 is
2 on
4 your
4 side
3 you
3 can
4 stir
3 him
2 up
3 and
1 i
2 ll
3 let
3 him
5 alone
3 but
2 if
3 you
3 let
3 him
3 get
4 away
3 and
3 get
2 on
2 my
4 side
3 you
2 re
2 to
5 leave
3 him
5 alone
2 as
4 long
2 as
1 i
3 can
4 keep
3 him
4 from
8 crossing
4 over
3 all
5 right
2 go
5 ahead
5 start
3 him
2 up
3 the
4 tick
7 escaped
4 from
3 tom
9 presently
3 and
7 crossed
3 the
7 equator
3 joe
8 harassed
3 him
6 awhile
3 and
4 then
2 he
3 got
4 away
3 and
7 crossed
4 back
5 again
4 this
6 change
2 of
4 base
8 occurred
5 often
5 while
3 one
3 boy
3 was
8 worrying
3 the
4 tick
4 with
9 absorbing
8 interest
3 the
5 other
5 would
4 look
2 on
4 with
8 interest
2 as
6 strong
3 the
3 two
5 heads
5 bowed
8 together
4 over
3 the
5 slate
3 and
3 the
3 two
5 souls
4 dead
2 to
3 all
6 things
4 else
2 at
4 last
4 luck
6 seemed
2 to
6 settle
3 and
5 abide
4 with
3 joe
3 the
4 tick
5 tried
4 this
4 that
3 and
3 the
5 other
6 course
3 and
3 got
2 as
7 excited
3 and
2 as
7 anxious
2 as
3 the
4 boys
10 themselves
3 but
4 time
3 and
5 again
4 just
2 as
2 he
5 would
4 have
7 victory
2 in
3 his
4 very
5 grasp
2 so
2 to
5 speak
3 and
3 tom
1 s
7 fingers
5 would
2 be
9 twitching
2 to
5 begin
3 joe
1 s
3 pin
5 would
6 deftly
4 head
3 him
3 off
3 and
4 keep
10 possession
2 at
4 last
3 tom
5 could
5 stand
2 it
2 no
6 longer
3 the
10 temptation
3 was
3 too
6 strong
2 so
2 he
7 reached
3 out
3 and
4 lent
1 a
4 hand
4 with
3 his
3 pin
3 joe
3 was
5 angry

3 and
3 for

7 minutes
3 the
4 dust
9 continued

4 from
3 the
3 two
7 jackets
3 and
3 the
5 whole
6 school
2 to
5 enjoy
2 it
3 the
4 boys

8 absorbed
2 to

3 the
4 hush
4 that
3 had
6 stolen
4 upon
3 the
6 school
6 awhile
6 before
4 when
3 the

4 came
9 tiptoeing
4 down
3 the
4 room

2 he
3 had
12 contemplated
1 a
4 good
4 part
2 of

11 performance
6 before
2 he
11 contributed
3 his
3 bit
2 of
7 variety
2 to

3 was
2 no
6 answer
3 she
3 had
2 no
10 companions
3 but
7 silence
3 and
10 loneliness
2 so
3 she
3 sat
4 down
2 to
3 cry
5 again
3 and
7 upbraid
7 herself
3 and
2 by
4 this
4 time
3 the
8 scholars
5 began
2 to
6 gather
5 again
3 and
3 she
3 had
2 to
4 hide
3 her
6 griefs
3 and
5 still
3 her
6 broken
5 heart
3 and
4 take
2 up
3 the
5 cross
2 of
1 a
4 long
6 dreary
6 aching
9 afternoon
4 with
4 none
5 among
3 the
9 strangers
5 about
3 her
2 to
8 exchange
7 sorrows
4 with
7 chapter
4 viii
3 tom
6 dodged
6 hither
3 and
7 thither
7 through
5 lanes
5 until
2 he
3 was
4 well
3 out
2 of
3 the
5 track
2 of
9 returning
8 scholars
3 and
4 then
4 fell
4 into
1 a
5 moody
3 jog
2 he
7 crossed
1 a
5 small
6 branch
3 two
2 or
5 three
5 times
7 because
2 of
1 a
10 prevailing
8 juvenile
12 superstition
4 that
2 to
5 cross
5 water
7 baffled
7 pursuit
4 half
2 an
4 hour
5 later
2 he
3 was
12 disappearing
6 behind
3 the
7 douglas
7 mansion
2 on
3 the
6 summit
2 of
7 cardiff
4 hill
3 and
3 the
11 schoolhouse
3 was
6 hardly
15 distinguishable
4 away
3 off
2 in
3 the
6 valley
6 behind
3 him
2 he
7 entered
1 a
5 dense
4 wood
6 picked
3 his
8 pathless
3 way
2 to
3 the
6 centre
2 of
2 it
3 and
3 sat
4 down
2 on
1 a
5 mossy
4 spot
5 under
1 a
9 spreading
3 oak
5 there
3 was
3 not
4 even
1 a
6 zephyr
8 stirring
3 the
4 dead
7 noonday
4 heat
3 had
4 even
7 stilled
3 the
5 songs
2 of
3 the
5 birds
6 nature
3 lay
2 in
1 a
6 trance
4 that
3 was
6 broken
2 by
2 no
5 sound
3 but
3 the
10 occasional
3 far
3 off
9 hammering
2 of
1 a
10 woodpecker
3 and
4 this
6 seemed
2 to
6 render
3 the
9 pervading
7 silence
3 and
5 sense
2 of
10 loneliness
3 the
4 more
8 profound
3 the
3 boy
1 s
4 soul
3 was
7 steeped
2 in
10 melancholy
3 his
8 feelings
4 were
2 in
5 happy
6 accord
4 with
3 his
12 surroundings
2 he
3 sat
4 long
4 with
3 his
6 elbows
2 on
3 his
5 knees
3 and
3 his
4 chin
2 in
3 his
5 hands
10 meditating
2 it
6 seemed
2 to
3 him
4 that
4 life
3 was
3 but
1 a
7 trouble
2 at
4 best
3 and
2 he
4 more
4 than
4 half
6 envied
5 jimmy
6 hodges
2 so
6 lately
8 released
2 it
4 must
2 be
4 very
8 peaceful
2 he
7 thought
2 to
3 lie
3 and
7 slumber
3 and
5 dream
7 forever
3 and
4 ever
4 with
3 the
4 wind
10 whispering
7 through
3 the
5 trees
3 and
9 caressing
3 the
5 grass
3 and
3 the
7 flowers
4 over
3 the
5 grave
3 and
7 nothing
2 to
6 bother
3 and
6 grieve
5 about
4 ever
3 any
4 more
2 if
2 he
4 only
3 had
1 a
5 clean
6 sunday
6 school
6 record
2 he
5 could
2 be
7 willing
2 to
2 go
3 and
2 be
4 done
4 with
2 it
3 all
3 now
2 as
2 to
4 this
4 girl
4 what
3 had
2 he
4 done
7 nothing
2 he
3 had
5 meant
3 the
4 best
2 in
3 the
5 world
3 and
4 been
7 treated
4 like
1 a
3 dog
4 like
1 a
4 very
3 dog
3 she
5 would
2 be
5 sorry
4 some
3 day
5 maybe
4 when
2 it
3 was
3 too
4 late
2 ah
2 if
2 he
5 could
4 only
3 die
11 temporarily
3 but
3 the
7 elastic
5 heart
2 of
5 youth
6 cannot
2 be
10 compressed
4 into
3 one
11 constrained
5 shape
4 long
2 at
1 a
4 time
3 tom
9 presently
5 began
2 to
5 drift
10 insensibly
4 back
4 into
3 the
8 concerns
2 of
4 this
4 life
5 again
4 what
2 if
2 he
6 turned
3 his
4 back
3 now
3 and
11 disappeared
12 mysteriously
4 what
2 if
2 he
4 went
4 away
4 ever
2 so
3 far
4 away
4 into
7 unknown
9 countries
6 beyond
3 the
4 seas
3 and
5 never
4 came
4 back
3 any
4 more
3 how
5 would
3 she
4 feel
4 then
3 the
4 idea
2 of
5 being
1 a
5 clown
8 recurred
2 to
3 him
3 now
4 only
2 to
4 fill
3 him
4 with
7 disgust
3 for
9 frivolity
3 and
5 jokes
3 and
7 spotted
6 tights
4 were
2 an
7 offense
4 when
4 they
8 intruded
10 themselves
4 upon
1 a
6 spirit
4 that
3 was
7 exalted
4 into
3 the
5 vague
6 august
5 realm
2 of
3 the
8 romantic
2 no
2 he
5 would
2 be
1 a
7 soldier
3 and
6 return
5 after
4 long
5 years
3 all
3 war
4 worn
3 and
11 illustrious
2 no
6 better
5 still
2 he
5 would
4 join
3 the
7 indians
3 and
4 hunt
9 buffaloes
3 and
2 go
2 on
3 the
7 warpath
2 in
3 the
8 mountain
6 ranges
3 and
3 the
9 trackless
5 great
6 plains
2 of
3 the
3 far
4 west
3 and
4 away
2 in
3 the
6 future
4 come
4 back
1 a
5 great
5 chief
9 bristling
4 with
8 feathers
7 hideous
4 with
5 paint
3 and
6 prance
4 into
6 sunday
6 school
4 some
6 drowsy
6 summer
7 morning
4 with
1 a
13 bloodcurdling
3 war
5 whoop
3 and
4 sear
3 the
8 eyeballs
2 of
3 all
3 his
10 companions
4 with
12 unappeasable
4 envy
3 but
2 no
5 there
3 was
9 something
7 gaudier
4 even
4 than
4 this
2 he
5 would
2 be
1 a
6 pirate
4 that
3 was
2 it
3 now
3 his
6 future
3 lay
5 plain
6 before
3 him
3 and
7 glowing
4 with
12 unimaginable
8 splendor
3 how
3 his
4 name
5 would
4 fill
3 the
5 world
3 and
4 make
6 people
7 shudder
3 how
10 gloriously
2 he
5 would
2 go
7 plowing
3 the
7 dancing
4 seas
2 in
3 his
4 long
3 low
5 black
6 hulled
5 racer
3 the
6 spirit
2 of
3 the
5 storm
4 with
3 his
6 grisly
4 flag
6 flying
2 at
3 the
4 fore
3 and
2 at
3 the
6 zenith
2 of
3 his
4 fame
3 how
2 he
5 would
8 suddenly
6 appear
2 at
3 the
3 old
7 village
3 and
5 stalk
4 into
6 church
5 brown
3 and
7 weather
6 beaten
2 in
3 his
5 black
6 velvet
7 doublet
3 and
6 trunks
3 his
5 great
4 jack
5 boots
3 his
7 crimson
4 sash
3 his

9 bristling
4 with
5 horse
7 pistols
3 his
5 crime
6 rusted
7 cutlass
2 at
3 his
4 side
3 his
6 slouch
3 hat
4 with
6 waving
6 plumes
3 his
5 black
4 flag
8 unfurled
4 with
3 the
5 skull
3 and
10 crossbones
2 on
2 it
3 and
4 hear
4 with
8 swelling
7 ecstasy
3 the
11 whisperings
2 it
1 s
3 tom
6 sawyer
3 the
6 pirate
3 the
5 black
7 avenger
2 of
3 the
7 spanish
4 main
3 yes
2 it
3 was
7 settled
3 his
6 career
3 was
10 determined
2 he
5 would
3 run
4 away
4 from
4 home
3 and
5 enter
4 upon
2 it
2 he
5 would
5 start
3 the
4 very
4 next
7 morning
9 therefore
2 he
4 must
3 now
5 begin
2 to
3 get
5 ready
2 he
5 would
7 collect
3 his
9 resources
8 together
2 he
4 went
2 to
1 a
6 rotten
3 log
4 near
2 at
4 hand
3 and
5 began
2 to
3 dig
5 under
3 one
3 end
2 of
2 it
4 with
3 his
6 barlow
5 knife
2 he
4 soon
6 struck
4 wood
4 that
7 sounded
6 hollow
2 he
3 put
3 his
4 hand
5 there
3 and
7 uttered
4 this
11 incantation
12 impressively
4 what
4 hasn
1 t
4 come
4 here
4 come
4 what
1 s
4 here
4 stay
4 here
4 then
2 he
7 scraped
4 away
3 the
4 dirt
3 and
7 exposed
1 a
4 pine
7 shingle
2 he
4 took
2 it
2 up
3 and
9 disclosed
1 a
7 shapely
6 little
8 treasure
5 house
5 whose
6 bottom
3 and
5 sides
4 were
2 of
8 shingles
2 in
2 it
3 lay
1 a
6 marble
3 tom
1 s
12 astonishment
3 was
9 boundless
2 he
9 scratched
3 his
4 head
4 with
1 a
9 perplexed
3 air
3 and
4 said
4 well
4 that
5 beats
8 anything
4 then
2 he
6 tossed
3 the
6 marble
4 away
9 pettishly
3 and
5 stood
10 cogitating
3 the
5 truth
3 was
4 that
1 a
12 superstition
2 of
3 his
3 had
6 failed
4 here
5 which
2 he
3 and
3 all
3 his
8 comrades
3 had
6 always
6 looked
4 upon
2 as
10 infallible
2 if
3 you
6 buried
1 a
6 marble
4 with
7 certain
9 necessary
12 incantations
3 and
4 left
2 it
5 alone
1 a
9 fortnight
3 and
4 then
6 opened
3 the
5 place
4 with
3 the
11 incantation
2 he
3 had
4 just
4 used
3 you
5 would
4 find
4 that
3 all
3 the
7 marbles
3 you
3 had
4 ever
4 lost
3 had
8 gathered
10 themselves
8 together
5 there
8 meantime
2 no
6 matter
3 how
6 widely
4 they
3 had
4 been
9 separated
3 but
3 now
4 this
5 thing
3 had
8 actually
3 and
14 unquestionably
6 failed
3 tom
1 s
5 whole
9 structure
2 of
5 faith
3 was
6 shaken
2 to
3 its
11 foundations
2 he
3 had
4 many
1 a
4 time
5 heard
2 of
4 this
5 thing
10 succeeding
3 but
5 never
2 of
3 its
7 failing
6 before
2 it
3 did
3 not
5 occur
2 to
3 him
4 that
2 he
3 had
5 tried
2 it
7 several
5 times
6 before
7 himself
3 but
5 could
5 never
4 find
3 the
6 hiding
6 places
9 afterward
2 he
7 puzzled
4 over
3 the
6 matter
4 some
4 time
3 and
7 finally
7 decided
4 that
4 some
5 witch
3 had
10 interfered
3 and
6 broken
3 the
5 charm
2 he
7 thought
2 he
5 would
7 satisfy
7 himself
2 on
4 that
5 point
2 so
2 he
8 searched
6 around
4 till
2 he
5 found
1 a
5 small
5 sandy
4 spot
4 with
1 a
6 little
6 funnel
6 shaped
10 depression
2 in
2 it
2 he
4 laid
7 himself
4 down
3 and
3 put
3 his
5 mouth
5 close
2 to
4 this
10 depression
3 and
6 called
6 doodle
3 bug
6 doodle
3 bug
4 tell
2 me
4 what
1 i
4 want
2 to
4 know
6 doodle
3 bug
6 doodle
3 bug
4 tell
2 me
4 what
1 i
4 want
2 to
4 know
3 the
4 sand
5 began
2 to
4 work
3 and
9 presently
1 a
5 small
5 black
3 bug
8 appeared
3 for
1 a
6 second
3 and
4 then
6 darted
5 under
5 again
2 in
1 a
6 fright
2 he
4 dasn
1 t
4 tell
2 so
2 it
3 was
1 a
5 witch
4 that
4 done
2 it
1 i
4 just
6 knowed
2 it
2 he
4 well
4 knew
3 the
8 futility
2 of
6 trying
2 to
7 contend
7 against
7 witches
2 so
2 he
4 gave
2 up
11 discouraged
3 but
2 it
8 occurred
2 to
3 him
4 that
2 he
5 might
2 as
4 well
4 have
3 the
6 marble
2 he
3 had
4 just
6 thrown
4 away
3 and
9 therefore
2 he
4 went
3 and
4 made
1 a
7 patient
6 search
3 for
2 it
3 but
2 he
5 could
3 not
4 find
2 it
3 now
2 he
4 went
4 back
2 to
3 his
8 treasure
5 house
3 and
9 carefully
6 placed
7 himself
4 just
2 as
2 he
3 had
4 been
8 standing
4 when
2 he
6 tossed
3 the
6 marble
4 away
4 then
2 he
4 took
7 another
6 marble
4 from
3 his
6 pocket
3 and
6 tossed
2 it
2 in
3 the
4 same
3 way
6 saying
7 brother
2 go
4 find
4 your
7 brother
2 he
7 watched
5 where
2 it
7 stopped

3 the

3 off
8 grieving
4 that

3 and
9 wondering

3 and
3 sid
3 was
4 soon
6 asleep
3 tom
3 lay
5 awake
3 and
6 waited
2 in
8 restless
10 impatience
4 when
2 it
6 seemed
2 to
3 him
4 that
2 it
4 must
2 be
6 nearly
8 daylight
2 he
5 heard
3 the
5 clock
6 strike
3 ten
4 this
3 was
7 despair
2 he
5 would
4 have
6 tossed
3 and
8 fidgeted
2 as
3 his
6 nerves
8 demanded
3 but
2 he
3 was
6 afraid
2 he
5 might
4 wake
3 sid
2 so
2 he
3 lay
5 still
3 and
6 stared
2 up
4 into
3 the
4 dark
10 everything
3 was
8 dismally
5 still
2 by
3 and
2 by
3 out
2 of
3 the
9 stillness
6 little
8 scarcely
11 perceptible
6 noises
5 began
2 to
9 emphasize
10 themselves
3 the
7 ticking
2 of
3 the
5 clock
5 began
2 to
5 bring
6 itself
4 into
6 notice
3 old
5 beams
5 began
2 to
5 crack
12 mysteriously
3 the

6 abroad
1 a
8 measured
7 muffled
5 snore
6 issued
4 from

3 and
3 now
3 the
8 tiresome
8 chirping
2 of
1 a
7 cricket
4 that
2 no
5 human
9 ingenuity
5 could
6 locate
5 began
4 next
3 the
7 ghastly
7 ticking
2 of

10 deathwatch
2 in
3 the
4 wall
2 at
3 the
3 bed

4 made
3 tom
7 shudder
2 it
5 meant

1 s
4 days
4 were

4 then
3 the
4 howl
2 of
1 a
3 far
3 off
3 dog
4 rose
2 on
3 the
5 night

3 and
3 was
8 answered
2 by

7 fainter
4 howl
4 from
1 a
7 remoter
8 distance
3 tom
3 was
2 in
2 an
5 agony
2 at
4 last
2 he
3 was
9 satisfied
4 that
4 time
3 had
6 ceased
3 and
8 eternity
5 begun
2 he
5 began
2 to
4 doze
2 in
5 spite
2 of
7 himself
3 the
5 clock
6 chimed
6 eleven
3 but
2 he
3 did
3 not
4 hear
2 it
3 and
4 then
5 there
4 came

1 a
4 most
10 melancholy
12 caterwauling
3 the
7 raising
2 of
1 a

9 disturbed
3 him
1 a

2 of

3 you

3 and
3 the

2 of
2 an
5 empty
6 bottle
7 against
3 the
4 back
2 of
3 his
4 aunt
1 s
8 woodshed
7 brought

2 in
2 at

7 bedroom
6 window
3 the
5 night
3 was
6 almost
5 spent
2 he
9 undressed
4 with
9 excessive
7 caution
3 and

6 asleep
14 congratulating
7 himself
4 that
6 nobody
4 knew
2 of
3 his
8 escapade
2 he
3 was
3 not
5 aware
4 that
3 the
6 gently
7 snoring
3 sid

4 hour
4 when

3 sid

7 dressed
3 and
4 gone
5 there
3 was
1 a
4 late
4 look
2 in
3 the
5 light
1 a
4 late
5 sense
2 in
3 the
10 atmosphere
2 he
3 was
8 startled
3 why
3 had
2 he
3 not
4 been
6 called
10 persecuted
4 till
2 he
3 was
2 up
2 as
5 usual
3 the
7 thought
6 filled
3 him
4 with
7 bodings
6 within
4 five
7 minutes
2 he
3 was
7 dressed
3 and
4 down
6 stairs
7 feeling
4 sore
3 and
6 drowsy
3 the
6 family
4 were
5 still
2 at
5 table
3 but
4 they
3 had
8 finished
9 breakfast
5 there
3 was
2 no
5 voice
2 of
6 rebuke
3 but
5 there
4 were
7 averted
4 eyes
5 there
3 was
1 a
7 silence
3 and
2 an
3 air
2 of
9 solemnity
4 that
6 struck
1 a
5 chill
2 to
3 the
7 culprit
1 s
5 heart
2 he
3 sat
4 down
3 and
5 tried
2 to
4 seem
3 gay
3 but
2 it
3 was
2 up
4 hill
4 work
2 it
6 roused
2 no
5 smile
2 no
8 response
3 and
2 he
6 lapsed
4 into
7 silence
3 and
3 let
3 his
5 heart
4 sink
4 down
2 to
3 the
6 depths
5 after
9 breakfast
3 his
4 aunt
4 took
3 him
5 aside
3 and
3 tom
6 almost
10 brightened
2 in
3 the
4 hope
4 that
2 he
3 was
5 going
2 to
2 be
7 flogged
3 but
2 it
3 was
3 not
2 so
3 his
4 aunt
4 wept
4 over
3 him
3 and
5 asked
3 him
3 how
2 he
5 could
2 go
3 and
5 break
3 her
3 old
5 heart
2 so
3 and
7 finally
4 told
3 him
2 to
2 go
2 on
3 and
4 ruin
7 himself
3 and
5 bring
3 her
4 gray
5 hairs
4 with
6 sorrow
2 to
3 the
5 grave
3 for
2 it
3 was
2 no
3 use
3 for
3 her
2 to
3 try
3 any
4 more
4 this
3 was
5 worse
4 than
1 a
8 thousand
9 whippings
3 and
3 tom
1 s
5 heart
3 was
5 sorer
3 now
4 than
3 his
4 body
2 he
5 cried
2 he
7 pleaded
3 for
11 forgiveness
8 promised
2 to
6 reform
4 over
3 and
4 over
5 again
3 and
4 then
8 received
3 his
9 dismissal
7 feeling
4 that
2 he
3 had
3 won

3 the

3 the

3 ran
3 and
2 it
3 was
4 said
4 that
1 a

3 not
7 because
2 he
5 would
3 not
1 a
8 thousand
5 times

2 he
6 wormed
3 his

7 through

3 and
3 saw
3 the

9 spectacle
2 it
6 seemed
2 to
3 him
2 an

3 him
4 with
1 a

12 hopelessness
2 in

7 hearted
4 liar
4 reel
3 off
3 his

9 statement
4 they
9 expecting

5 clear
3 sky
5 would
7 deliver
3 god
1 s
10 lightnings
4 upon

3 and
9 wondering

3 and
4 when

3 and
4 save

8 vanished
4 away
3 for
7 plainly
4 this
9 miscreant
3 had
4 sold
7 himself
2 to
5 satan
3 and
2 it
5 would
2 be
5 fatal
2 to

8 property
2 of
4 such
1 a
5 power
2 as
4 that
3 why
4 didn

4 fell
2 to
7 sobbing
5 again
5 injun
3 joe
8 repeated
3 his
9 statement
4 just
2 as
6 calmly
1 a
3 few
7 minutes
9 afterward
2 on
3 the
7 inquest
5 under
4 oath
3 and
3 the
4 boys
6 seeing
4 that
3 the
10 lightnings
4 were
5 still
8 withheld
4 were
9 confirmed
2 in
5 their

7 himself
2 to

5 devil
2 he

9 balefully
11 interesting
6 object

3 and
4 they
5 could
3 not
4 take
5 their
10 fascinated
4 eyes
4 from
3 his
4 face
4 they
8 inwardly
8 resolved
2 to
5 watch
3 him
6 nights
4 when
11 opportunity
6 should
5 offer
2 in
3 the
4 hope
2 of
7 getting
1 a
7 glimpse

6 helped
2 to
5 raise
3 the

8 murdered
3 man
3 and
3 put
2 it
2 in
1 a

3 for

3 and
2 it
3 was
9 whispered
7 through
3 the
10 shuddering
5 crowd
4 that
3 the
5 wound
4 bled
1 a
6 little
3 the
4 boys
7 thought
4 that
4 this
5 happy
12 circumstance
5 would
4 turn
9 suspicion
2 in
3 the
5 right
9 direction
3 but
4 they
4 were
12 disappointed
3 for
4 more
4 than
3 one
8 villager
8 remarked

3 but
7 luckily
3 the

6 passed
3 out
2 of

3 and
3 she
4 came
2 to

3 tom
3 got
3 out
2 of
3 the

2 as
5 quick
2 as
2 he
9 plausibly
5 could
3 and
5 after
4 that
2 he
10 complained
2 of
9 toothache
3 for
1 a
4 week
3 and
4 tied
2 up
3 his
4 jaws
5 every
5 night
2 he
5 never
4 knew
4 that
3 sid
3 lay
7 nightly
8 watching
3 and
10 frequently
7 slipped
3 the
7 bandage
4 free
3 and
4 then
6 leaned
2 on
3 his
5 elbow
9 listening
1 a
4 good
5 while
2 at
1 a
4 time
3 and
9 afterward
7 slipped
3 the
7 bandage
4 back
2 to
3 its
5 place
5 again
3 tom
1 s
8 distress
2 of
4 mind
4 wore
3 off
9 gradually
3 and
3 the
9 toothache
4 grew
7 irksome
3 and
3 was
9 discarded
2 if
3 sid
6 really
7 managed
2 to
4 make
8 anything
3 out
2 of
3 tom
1 s
10 disjointed
10 mutterings
2 he
4 kept
2 it
2 to
7 himself
2 it
6 seemed
2 to
3 tom
4 that
3 his
11 schoolmates
5 never
5 would
3 get
4 done
7 holding
8 inquests
2 on
4 dead
4 cats
3 and
4 thus
7 keeping
3 his
7 trouble
7 present
2 to
3 his
4 mind
3 sid
7 noticed
4 that
3 tom
5 never
3 was
7 coroner
2 at
3 one
2 of
5 these
9 inquiries
6 though
2 it
3 had
4 been
3 his
5 habit
2 to
4 take
3 the
4 lead
2 in
3 all
3 new
11 enterprises
2 he
7 noticed
3 too
4 that
3 tom
5 never
5 acted
2 as
1 a
7 witness
3 and
4 that
3 was
7 strange
3 and
3 sid
3 did
3 not
8 overlook
3 the
4 fact
4 that
3 tom
4 even
6 showed
1 a
6 marked
8 aversion
2 to
5 these
8 inquests
3 and
6 always
7 avoided
4 them
4 when
2 he
5 could
3 sid
9 marvelled
3 but
4 said
7 nothing
7 however
4 even
8 inquests
4 went
3 out
2 of
5 vogue
2 at
4 last
3 and
6 ceased
2 to
7 torture
3 tom
1 s
10 conscience
5 every
3 day
2 or
3 two
6 during
4 this
4 time
2 of
6 sorrow
3 tom
7 watched
3 his
11 opportunity
3 and
4 went
2 to
3 the
6 little
6 grated
4 jail
6 window
3 and
8 smuggled
4 such
5 small
8 comforts
7 through
2 to
3 the
8 murderer
2 as
2 he
5 could
3 get
4 hold
2 of
3 the
4 jail
3 was
1 a
8 trifling
6 little
5 brick
3 den
4 that
5 stood
2 in
1 a
5 marsh
2 at
3 the
4 edge
2 of
3 the
7 village
3 and
2 no
6 guards
4 were
8 afforded
3 for

6 indeed
2 it
3 was
6 seldom
8 occupied
5 these
9 offerings
7 greatly
6 helped
2 to
4 ease

3 and
7 drowned
3 him
4 with
1 a
6 deluge
2 of
4 cold
5 water
4 then
3 she
8 scrubbed
3 him
4 down
4 with
1 a
5 towel
4 like
1 a
4 file
3 and
2 so
7 brought
3 him
2 to
4 then
3 she
6 rolled
3 him
2 up
2 in
1 a
3 wet
5 sheet
3 and
3 put
3 him
4 away
5 under

4 till
3 she
7 sweated
3 his
4 soul
5 clean
3 and
3 the
6 yellow
6 stains
2 of
2 it
4 came
7 through
3 his
5 pores
2 as
3 tom
4 said
3 yet
15 notwithstanding
3 all
4 this
3 the
3 boy
4 grew
4 more
3 and
4 more
10 melancholy
3 and
4 pale
3 and
8 dejected
3 she
5 added
3 hot
5 baths
4 sitz
5 baths
6 shower
5 baths
3 and
7 plunges
3 the
3 boy
8 remained
2 as
6 dismal
2 as
1 a
6 hearse
3 she
5 began
2 to
6 assist
3 the
5 water
4 with
1 a
4 slim
7 oatmeal
4 diet
3 and
7 blister
8 plasters
3 she
10 calculated
3 his
8 capacity
2 as
3 she
5 would
1 a

1 s
3 and
6 filled
3 him
2 up
5 every
3 day
4 with
5 quack
4 cure
4 alls
3 tom
3 had
6 become
11 indifferent
2 to
11 persecution
2 by
4 this
4 time
4 this
5 phase
6 filled
3 the
3 old
4 lady
1 s
5 heart
4 with
13 consternation
4 this
12 indifference
4 must
2 be
6 broken
2 up
2 at
3 any
4 cost
3 now
3 she
5 heard
2 of
4 pain
6 killer
3 for
3 the
5 first
4 time
3 she
7 ordered
1 a
3 lot
2 at
4 once
3 she
6 tasted
2 it
3 and
3 was
6 filled
4 with
9 gratitude
2 it
3 was
6 simply
4 fire
2 in
1 a
6 liquid
4 form
3 she
7 dropped
3 the
5 water
9 treatment
3 and
10 everything
4 else
3 and
6 pinned
3 her
5 faith
2 to
4 pain
6 killer
3 she
4 gave
3 tom
1 a
11 teaspoonful
3 and
7 watched
4 with
3 the
7 deepest
7 anxiety
3 for
3 the
6 result
3 her
8 troubles
4 were
9 instantly
2 at
4 rest
3 her
4 soul
2 at
5 peace
5 again
3 for
3 the
12 indifference
3 was
6 broken
2 up
3 the
3 boy
5 could
3 not
4 have
5 shown
1 a
6 wilder
8 heartier
8 interest
2 if
3 she
3 had
5 built
1 a
4 fire
5 under
3 him
3 tom
4 felt
4 that
2 it
3 was
4 time
2 to
4 wake
2 up
4 this
4 sort
2 of
4 life
5 might
2 be
8 romantic
6 enough
2 in
3 his
8 blighted
9 condition
3 but
2 it
3 was
7 getting
2 to
4 have
3 too
6 little
9 sentiment
3 and
3 too
4 much
11 distracting
7 variety
5 about
2 it
2 so
2 he
7 thought
4 over
7 various
5 plans
3 for
6 relief
3 and
7 finally
3 hit
3 pon
4 that
2 of
10 professing
2 to
2 be
4 fond
2 of
4 pain
6 killer
2 he
5 asked
3 for
2 it
2 so
5 often
4 that
2 he
6 became
1 a
8 nuisance
3 and
3 his
4 aunt
5 ended
2 by
7 telling
3 him
2 to
4 help
7 himself
3 and
4 quit
9 bothering
3 her
2 if
2 it
3 had
4 been
3 sid
3 she
5 would
4 have
3 had
2 no
10 misgivings
2 to
5 alloy
3 her
7 delight
3 but
5 since
2 it
3 was
3 tom
3 she
7 watched
3 the
6 bottle
13 clandestinely
3 she
5 found
4 that
3 the
8 medicine
3 did
6 really
8 diminish
3 but
2 it
3 did
3 not
5 occur
2 to
3 her
4 that
3 the
3 boy
3 was
7 mending
3 the
6 health
2 of
1 a
5 crack
2 in
3 the
7 sitting
4 room
5 floor
4 with

3 one
3 day
3 tom
3 was
2 in
3 the

4 when
3 his
4 aunt
1 s
6 yellow
3 cat
4 came
5 along
7 purring
5 eying
3 the
8 teaspoon
12 avariciously
3 and
7 begging
3 for
1 a
5 taste
3 tom
4 said
3 don
1 t
3 ask
3 for
2 it
6 unless
3 you
4 want
2 it
5 peter
3 but
5 peter
9 signified

2 it
3 you
6 better
4 make

5 peter
3 was
9 agreeable
2 so
3 tom
5 pried
3 his

4 open
3 and
6 poured
4 down

4 head
4 over
3 his
8 shoulder
3 and
3 his
5 voice
11 proclaiming
3 his
12 unappeasable
9 happiness
4 then
2 he
4 went
7 tearing
6 around

11 crestfallen
7 chapter
4 xiii
3 tom
1 s
4 mind
3 was
4 made
2 up
3 now
2 he
3 was
6 gloomy
3 and
9 desperate
2 he
3 was
1 a
8 forsaken
10 friendless
3 boy
2 he
4 said
6 nobody
5 loved
3 him
4 when
4 they
5 found
3 out
4 what
4 they
3 had
6 driven
3 him
2 to
7 perhaps
4 they
5 would
2 be
5 sorry
2 he
3 had
5 tried
2 to
2 do
5 right
3 and
3 get
5 along
3 but
4 they
5 would
3 not
3 let
3 him
5 since
7 nothing
5 would
2 do
4 them
3 but
2 to
2 be
3 rid
2 of
3 him
3 let
2 it
2 be
2 so
3 and
3 let
4 them
5 blame
3 him
3 for
3 the
12 consequences
3 why
7 shouldn
1 t
4 they
4 what
5 right
3 had
3 the
10 friendless
2 to
8 complain
3 yes
4 they
3 had
6 forced
3 him
2 to
2 it
2 at
4 last
2 he
5 would
4 lead
1 a
4 life
2 of
5 crime
5 there
3 was
2 no
6 choice
2 by
4 this
4 time
2 he
3 was
3 far
4 down
6 meadow
4 lane
3 and
3 the
4 bell
3 for
6 school
2 to
4 take
2 up
7 tinkled
7 faintly
4 upon
3 his
3 ear
2 he
6 sobbed
3 now
2 to
5 think
2 he
6 should
5 never
5 never
4 hear
4 that
3 old
8 familiar
5 sound
3 any
4 more
2 it
3 was
4 very
4 hard
3 but
2 it
3 was
6 forced
2 on
3 him
5 since
2 he
3 was
6 driven
3 out
4 into
3 the
4 cold
5 world
2 he
4 must
6 submit
3 but
2 he
7 forgave
4 them
4 then
3 the
4 sobs
4 came
5 thick
3 and
4 fast
4 just
2 at
4 this
5 point
2 he
3 met
3 his
4 soul
1 s
5 sworn
7 comrade
3 joe
6 harper
4 hard
4 eyed
3 and
4 with
9 evidently
1 a
5 great
3 and
6 dismal
7 purpose
2 in
3 his
5 heart
7 plainly
4 here
4 were
3 two
5 souls
4 with
3 but
1 a
6 single
7 thought
3 tom
6 wiping
3 his
4 eyes
4 with
3 his
6 sleeve
5 began
2 to
7 blubber
3 out
9 something
5 about
1 a
10 resolution
2 to
6 escape
4 from
4 hard
5 usage
3 and
4 lack
2 of
8 sympathy
2 at
4 home
2 by
7 roaming
6 abroad
4 into
3 the
5 great
5 world
5 never
2 to
6 return
3 and
5 ended
2 by
6 hoping
4 that
3 joe
5 would
3 not
6 forget
3 him
3 but
2 it
10 transpired
4 that
4 this
3 was
1 a
7 request
5 which
3 joe
3 had
4 just
4 been
5 going
2 to
4 make
2 of
3 tom
3 and
3 had
4 come
2 to
4 hunt
3 him
2 up
3 for
4 that
7 purpose
3 his
6 mother
3 had
7 whipped
3 him
3 for
8 drinking
4 some
5 cream
5 which
2 he
3 had
5 never
6 tasted
3 and
4 knew
7 nothing
5 about
2 it
3 was
5 plain
4 that
3 she
3 was
5 tired
2 of
3 him
3 and
6 wished
3 him
2 to
2 go
2 if
3 she
4 felt
4 that
3 way
5 there
3 was
7 nothing
3 for
3 him
2 to
2 do
3 but
7 succumb
2 he
5 hoped
3 she
5 would
2 be
5 happy
3 and
5 never
6 regret
6 having
6 driven
3 her
4 poor
3 boy
3 out
4 into
3 the
9 unfeeling
5 world
2 to
6 suffer
3 and
3 die
2 as
3 the
3 two
4 boys
6 walked
9 sorrowing
5 along
4 they
4 made
1 a
3 new
7 compact
2 to
5 stand
2 by
4 each
5 other
3 and
2 be
8 brothers
3 and
5 never
8 separate
4 till
5 death
8 relieved
4 them
2 of
5 their
8 troubles
4 then
4 they
5 began
2 to
3 lay
5 their
5 plans
3 joe
3 was
3 for
5 being
1 a
6 hermit
3 and
6 living
2 on
6 crusts
2 in
1 a
6 remote
4 cave
3 and
5 dying
4 some
4 time
2 of
4 cold
3 and
4 want
3 and
5 grief
3 but
5 after
9 listening
2 to
3 tom
2 he
8 conceded
4 that
5 there
4 were
4 some
11 conspicuous
10 advantages
5 about
1 a
4 life
2 of
5 crime
3 and
2 so
2 he
9 consented
2 to
2 be
1 a
6 pirate
5 three
5 miles
5 below
2 st
10 petersburg
2 at
1 a
5 point
5 where
3 the
11 mississippi
5 river
3 was
1 a
6 trifle
4 over
1 a
4 mile
4 wide
5 there
3 was
1 a
4 long
6 narrow
6 wooded
6 island
4 with
1 a
7 shallow
3 bar
2 at
3 the
4 head
2 of
2 it
3 and
4 this
7 offered
4 well
2 as
1 a
10 rendezvous
2 it
3 was
3 not
9 inhabited
2 it
3 lay
3 far
4 over
6 toward
3 the
7 further
5 shore
7 abreast
1 a
5 dense
3 and
6 almost
6 wholly
9 unpeopled
6 forest
2 so
7 jackson
1 s
6 island
3 was
6 chosen
3 who
4 were
2 to
2 be
3 the
8 subjects
2 of
5 their
8 piracies
3 was
1 a
6 matter
4 that
3 did
3 not
5 occur
2 to
4 them
4 then
4 they
6 hunted
2 up
11 huckleberry
4 finn
3 and
2 he
6 joined
4 them
8 promptly
3 for
3 all
7 careers
4 were
3 one
2 to
3 him
2 he
3 was
11 indifferent
4 they
9 presently
9 separated
2 to
4 meet
2 at
1 a
6 lonely
4 spot
2 on
3 the
5 river
4 bank
3 two
5 miles
5 above
3 the
7 village
2 at
3 the
8 favorite
4 hour
5 which
3 was
8 midnight
5 there
3 was
1 a
5 small
3 log
4 raft
5 there
5 which
4 they
5 meant
2 to
7 capture
4 each
5 would
5 bring
5 hooks
3 and
5 lines
3 and
4 such
9 provision
2 as
2 he
5 could
5 steal
2 in
3 the
4 most
4 dark
3 and
10 mysterious
3 way
2 as
6 became
7 outlaws
3 and
6 before
3 the
9 afternoon
3 was
4 done
4 they
3 had
3 all
7 managed
2 to
5 enjoy
3 the
5 sweet
5 glory
2 of
9 spreading
3 the
4 fact
4 that
6 pretty
4 soon
3 the
4 town
5 would
4 hear
9 something
3 all
3 who
3 got
4 this
5 vague
4 hint
4 were
9 cautioned
2 to
2 be
3 mum
3 and
4 wait
5 about
8 midnight
3 tom
7 arrived
4 with
1 a
6 boiled
3 ham
3 and
1 a
3 few
7 trifles
3 and
7 stopped
2 in
1 a
5 dense
11 undergrowth
2 on
1 a
5 small
5 bluff
11 overlooking
3 the
7 meeting
5 place
2 it
3 was
9 starlight
3 and
4 very
5 still
3 the
6 mighty
5 river
3 lay
4 like
2 an
5 ocean
2 at
4 rest
3 tom
8 listened
1 a
6 moment
3 but
2 no
5 sound
9 disturbed
3 the
5 quiet
4 then
2 he
4 gave
1 a
3 low
8 distinct
7 whistle
2 it
3 was
8 answered
4 from
5 under
3 the
5 bluff
3 tom
8 whistled
5 twice
4 more
5 these
7 signals
4 were
8 answered
2 in
3 the
4 same
3 way
4 then
1 a
7 guarded
5 voice
4 said
3 who
4 goes

9 furnished
5 these
6 titles
4 from
3 his
8 favorite
10 literature
3 tis
4 well
4 give
3 the
11 countersign
3 two
6 hoarse
8 whispers
9 delivered
3 the
4 same
5 awful
4 word
14 simultaneously
2 to
3 the
8 brooding
5 night
5 blood
4 then
3 tom
7 tumbled
3 his
3 ham
4 over
3 the
5 bluff
3 and
3 let
7 himself
4 down
5 after
2 it
7 tearing
4 both
4 skin
3 and
7 clothes
2 to
4 some
6 extent
2 in
3 the

5 there
3 was
2 an
4 easy
11 comfortable
4 path
5 along
3 the
5 shore
5 under
3 the
5 bluff
3 but
2 it
6 lacked
3 the
10 advantages
2 of
10 difficulty
3 and
6 danger
2 so
6 valued
2 by
1 a
6 pirate
3 the
6 terror
2 of
3 the
4 seas
3 had
7 brought
1 a
4 side
2 of
5 bacon
3 and
3 had
5 about
4 worn
7 himself
3 out
4 with
7 getting
2 it
5 there
4 finn
3 the
3 red
6 handed
3 had
6 stolen
1 a
7 skillet
3 and
1 a
8 quantity
2 of
4 half
5 cured
4 leaf
7 tobacco
3 and
3 had
4 also
7 brought
1 a
3 few
4 corn
4 cobs
2 to
4 make
5 pipes
4 with
3 but
4 none
2 of
3 the
7 pirates
6 smoked
2 or
6 chewed
3 but
7 himself
3 the
5 black
7 avenger
2 of
3 the
7 spanish
4 main
4 said
2 it
5 would
5 never
2 do
2 to
5 start
7 without
4 some
4 fire
4 that
3 was
1 a
4 wise
7 thought
7 matches
4 were
6 hardly
5 known
5 there
2 in
4 that
3 day
4 they
3 saw
1 a
4 fire
11 smouldering
4 upon
1 a
5 great
4 raft
1 a
7 hundred
5 yards
5 above
3 and
4 they
4 went
10 stealthily
7 thither
3 and
6 helped
10 themselves
2 to
1 a
5 chunk
4 they
4 made
2 an
8 imposing
9 adventure
2 of
2 it
6 saying
4 hist
5 every
3 now
3 and
4 then
3 and
8 suddenly
7 halting
4 with
6 finger
2 on
3 lip
6 moving
4 with
5 hands
2 on
9 imaginary
6 dagger
5 hilts
3 and
6 giving
6 orders
2 in
6 dismal
8 whispers
4 that
2 if
3 the
3 foe
7 stirred
2 to
3 let
3 him
4 have
2 it
2 to
3 the
4 hilt
7 because
4 dead
3 men
4 tell
2 no
5 tales
4 they
4 knew
4 well
6 enough
4 that
3 the
8 raftsmen
4 were
3 all
4 down
2 at
3 the
7 village
6 laying
2 in
6 stores
2 or
6 having
1 a
5 spree
3 but
5 still
4 that
3 was
2 no
6 excuse
3 for
5 their
10 conducting
4 this
5 thing
2 in
2 an
11 unpiratical
3 way
4 they

3 and
4 then
3 lay
2 on

3 the

6 hardly
1 a

4 said
6 during

3 the

5 sweep
2 of
4 star
6 gemmed
5 water
11 unconscious
2 of
3 the
10 tremendous
5 event
4 that
3 was
9 happening
3 the
5 black
7 avenger
5 stood
5 still
4 with
6 folded

7 looking
3 his

4 upon
3 the

3 and

9 dauntless
5 heart
5 going
2 to

4 with
1 a

2 on

3 was
3 but
1 a

2 to
6 remove
7 jackson
1 s
6 island
6 beyond
7 eyeshot
2 of
3 the

4 with
1 a
6 broken
3 and
9 satisfied
5 heart
3 the
5 other
7 pirates
4 were
7 looking
5 their
4 last
3 too
3 and
4 they
3 all
6 looked
2 so
4 long
4 that
4 they
4 came
4 near
7 letting
3 the
7 current
5 drift
4 them

4 come
4 fast
6 enough
5 after
4 they
6 should
4 have
5 begun
5 their
10 adventures
4 they
4 made
3 him
10 understand
4 that
3 his
4 poor
4 rags
5 would
2 do
2 to
5 begin
4 with
6 though
2 it
3 was
9 customary
3 for
7 wealthy
7 pirates
2 to
5 start
4 with
1 a
6 proper
8 wardrobe
9 gradually
5 their
4 talk
4 died
3 out
3 and
10 drowsiness
5 began
2 to
5 steal
4 upon
3 the
7 eyelids
2 of
3 the
6 little
5 waifs
3 the
4 pipe
7 dropped
4 from
3 the
7 fingers
2 of
3 the
3 red
6 handed
3 and
2 he
5 slept
3 the
5 sleep
2 of
3 the
10 conscience
4 free
3 and
3 the
5 weary
3 the
6 terror
2 of
3 the
4 seas
3 and
3 the
5 black
7 avenger
2 of
3 the
7 spanish
4 main
3 had
4 more
10 difficulty
2 in
7 getting
2 to
5 sleep
4 they
4 said
5 their
7 prayers
8 inwardly
3 and
5 lying
4 down
5 since
5 there
3 was
6 nobody
5 there
4 with
9 authority
2 to
4 make
4 them
5 kneel
3 and
6 recite
5 aloud
2 in
5 truth
4 they
3 had
1 a
4 mind
3 not
2 to
3 say
4 them
2 at
3 all
3 but
4 they
4 were
6 afraid
2 to
7 proceed
2 to
4 such
7 lengths
2 as
4 that
4 lest
4 they
5 might
4 call
4 down
1 a
6 sudden
3 and
7 special
11 thunderbolt
4 from
6 heaven
4 then
2 at
4 once
4 they
7 reached
3 and
7 hovered
4 upon
3 the
8 imminent
5 verge
2 of
5 sleep
3 but
2 an
8 intruder
4 came
3 now
4 that
5 would
3 not
4 down
2 it
3 was
10 conscience
4 they
5 began
2 to
4 feel
1 a
5 vague
4 fear
4 that
4 they
3 had
4 been
5 doing
5 wrong
2 to
3 run
4 away
3 and
4 next
4 they
7 thought
2 of
3 the
6 stolen
4 meat
3 and
4 then
3 the
4 real
7 torture
4 came
4 they
5 tried
2 to
5 argue
2 it
4 away
2 by
9 reminding
10 conscience
4 that
4 they
3 had
9 purloined
10 sweetmeats
3 and
6 apples
6 scores
2 of
5 times
3 but
10 conscience
3 was
3 not
2 to
2 be
8 appeased
2 by
4 such
4 thin
14 plausibilities
2 it
6 seemed
2 to
4 them
2 in
3 the
3 end
4 that
5 there
3 was
2 no
7 getting
6 around
3 the
8 stubborn
4 fact
4 that
6 taking
10 sweetmeats
3 was
4 only
7 hooking
5 while
6 taking
5 bacon
3 and
4 hams
3 and
4 such
9 valuables
3 was
5 plain
6 simple
8 stealing
3 and
5 there
3 was
1 a
7 command
7 against
4 that
2 in
3 the
5 bible
2 so
4 they
8 inwardly
8 resolved
4 that
2 so
4 long
2 as
4 they
8 remained
2 in
3 the
8 business
5 their
8 piracies
6 should
3 not
5 again
2 be
7 sullied
4 with
3 the
5 crime
2 of
8 stealing
4 then
10 conscience
7 granted
1 a
5 truce
3 and
5 these
9 curiously
12 inconsistent
7 pirates
4 fell
10 peacefully
2 to
5 sleep
7 chapter
3 xiv
4 when
3 tom
5 awoke
2 in
3 the
7 morning
2 he
8 wondered
5 where
2 he
3 was
2 he
3 sat
2 up
3 and
6 rubbed
3 his
4 eyes
3 and
6 looked
6 around
4 then
2 he
12 comprehended
2 it
3 was
3 the
4 cool
4 gray
4 dawn
3 and
5 there
3 was
1 a
9 delicious
5 sense
2 of
6 repose
3 and
5 peace
2 in
3 the
4 deep
9 pervading
4 calm
3 and
7 silence
2 of
3 the
5 woods
3 not
1 a
4 leaf
7 stirred
3 not
1 a
5 sound
8 obtruded
4 upon
5 great
6 nature
1 s
10 meditation
6 beaded
8 dewdrops
5 stood
4 upon
3 the
6 leaves
3 and
7 grasses
1 a
5 white
5 layer
2 of
5 ashes
7 covered
3 the
4 fire
3 and
1 a
4 thin
4 blue
6 breath
2 of
5 smoke
4 rose
8 straight
4 into
3 the
3 air
3 joe
3 and
4 huck
5 still
5 slept
3 now
3 far
4 away
2 in
3 the
5 woods
1 a
4 bird
6 called
7 another
8 answered
9 presently
3 the
9 hammering
2 of
1 a
10 woodpecker
3 was
5 heard
9 gradually
3 the
4 cool
3 dim
4 gray
2 of
3 the
7 morning
8 whitened
3 and
2 as
9 gradually
6 sounds
10 multiplied
3 and
4 life
10 manifested
6 itself
3 the
6 marvel
2 of
6 nature
7 shaking
3 off
5 sleep
3 and
5 going
2 to
4 work
8 unfolded
6 itself
2 to
3 the
6 musing
3 boy
1 a
6 little
5 green
4 worm
4 came
8 crawling
4 over
1 a
4 dewy
4 leaf
7 lifting
3 two
6 thirds
2 of
3 his
4 body
4 into
3 the
3 air
4 from
4 time
2 to
4 time
3 and
8 sniffing
6 around
4 then
10 proceeding
5 again
3 for
2 he
3 was
9 measuring
3 tom
4 said
3 and
4 when
3 the
4 worm
10 approached
3 him
2 of
3 its
3 own
6 accord
2 he
3 sat
2 as
5 still
2 as
1 a
5 stone
4 with
3 his
5 hopes
6 rising
3 and
7 falling
2 by
5 turns
2 as
3 the
8 creature
5 still
4 came
6 toward
3 him
2 or
6 seemed
8 inclined
2 to
2 go
9 elsewhere
3 and
4 when
2 at
4 last
2 it
10 considered
1 a
7 painful
6 moment
4 with
3 its
6 curved
4 body
2 in
3 the
3 air
3 and
4 then
4 came
10 decisively
4 down
4 upon
3 tom
1 s
3 leg
3 and
5 began
1 a
7 journey
4 over
3 him
3 his
5 whole
5 heart
3 was
4 glad
3 for
4 that
5 meant
4 that
2 he
3 was
5 going
2 to
4 have
1 a
3 new
4 suit
2 of
7 clothes
7 without
3 the
6 shadow
2 of
1 a
5 doubt
1 a
5 gaudy
9 piratical
7 uniform
3 now
1 a
10 procession
2 of
4 ants
8 appeared
4 from
7 nowhere
2 in
10 particular
3 and
4 went
5 about
5 their
6 labors
3 one
9 struggled
8 manfully
2 by
4 with
1 a
4 dead
6 spider
4 five
5 times
2 as
3 big
2 as
6 itself
2 in
3 its
4 arms
3 and
6 lugged
2 it
8 straight
2 up
1 a
4 tree
5 trunk
1 a
5 brown
7 spotted
4 lady
3 bug
7 climbed
3 the
5 dizzy
6 height
2 of
1 a
5 grass
5 blade
3 and
3 tom
4 bent
4 down
5 close
2 to
2 it
3 and
4 said
4 lady
3 bug
4 lady
3 bug
3 fly
4 away
4 home
4 your
5 house
2 is
2 on

4 your
8 children
1 s
5 alone
3 and
3 she
4 took
4 wing
3 and
4 went
3 off
2 to
3 see
5 about
2 it
5 which
3 did
3 not
8 surprise
3 the
3 boy
3 for
2 he
4 knew
2 of
3 old
4 that
4 this
6 insect
3 was
9 credulous
5 about
14 conflagrations
3 and
2 he
3 had
9 practised
4 upon
3 its
10 simplicity
4 more
4 than
4 once
1 a
9 tumblebug
4 came
4 next
7 heaving
8 sturdily
2 at
3 its
4 ball
3 and
3 tom
7 touched
3 the
8 creature
2 to
3 see
2 it
4 shut
3 its
4 legs
7 against
3 its
4 body
3 and
7 pretend
2 to
2 be
4 dead
3 the
5 birds
4 were
6 fairly
7 rioting
2 by
4 this
4 time
1 a
7 catbird
3 the
8 northern
6 mocker
3 lit
2 in
1 a
4 tree
4 over
3 tom
1 s
4 head
3 and
7 trilled
3 out
3 her
10 imitations
2 of
3 her
9 neighbors
2 in
1 a
7 rapture
2 of
9 enjoyment
4 then
1 a
6 shrill
3 jay
5 swept
4 down
1 a
5 flash
2 of
4 blue
5 flame
3 and

2 on
1 a

6 almost
6 within
3 the
3 boy
1 s
5 reach
6 cocked
3 his
4 head
2 to
3 one
4 side
3 and
4 eyed
3 the
9 strangers
4 with
1 a
9 consuming
9 curiosity
1 a
4 gray
8 squirrel
3 and
1 a
3 big
6 fellow
2 of
3 the
3 fox
4 kind
4 came
9 skurrying
5 along
7 sitting
2 up
2 at
9 intervals
2 to
7 inspect
3 and
7 chatter
2 at
3 the
4 boys
3 for
3 the
4 wild
6 things
3 had
8 probably
5 never
4 seen
1 a
5 human
5 being
6 before
3 and
8 scarcely
4 knew
7 whether
2 to
2 be
6 afraid
2 or
3 not
3 all
6 nature
3 was
4 wide
5 awake
3 and
8 stirring
3 now
4 long
6 lances
2 of
8 sunlight
7 pierced
4 down
7 through
3 the
5 dense
7 foliage
3 far
3 and
4 near
3 and
1 a
3 few
11 butterflies
4 came
10 fluttering
4 upon
3 the
5 scene
3 tom
7 stirred
2 up
3 the
5 other
7 pirates
3 and
4 they
3 all
9 clattered
4 away
4 with
1 a
5 shout
3 and
2 in
1 a
6 minute
2 or
3 two
4 were
8 stripped
3 and
7 chasing
5 after
3 and
8 tumbling
4 over
4 each
5 other
2 in
3 the
7 shallow
6 limpid
5 water
2 of
3 the
5 white
7 sandbar
4 they
4 felt
2 no
7 longing
3 for
3 the
6 little
7 village
8 sleeping
2 in
3 the
8 distance
6 beyond
3 the
8 majestic
5 waste
2 of
5 water
1 a
7 vagrant
7 current
2 or
1 a
6 slight
4 rise
2 in
3 the
5 river
3 had
7 carried
3 off
5 their
4 raft
3 but
4 this
4 only
9 gratified
4 them
5 since
3 its
5 going
3 was
9 something
4 like
7 burning
3 the
6 bridge
7 between
4 them
3 and
12 civilization
4 they
4 came
4 back
2 to
4 camp
11 wonderfully
9 refreshed
4 glad
7 hearted
3 and
8 ravenous
3 and
4 they
4 soon
3 had
3 the
4 camp
4 fire
7 blazing
2 up
5 again
4 huck
5 found
1 a
6 spring
2 of
5 clear
4 cold
5 water
5 close
2 by
3 and
3 the
4 boys
4 made
4 cups
2 of
5 broad
3 oak
2 or
7 hickory
6 leaves
3 and
4 felt
4 that
5 water
9 sweetened
4 with
4 such
1 a
8 wildwood
5 charm
2 as
4 that
5 would
2 be
1 a
4 good
6 enough
10 substitute
3 for
6 coffee
5 while
3 joe
3 was
7 slicing
5 bacon
3 for
9 breakfast
3 tom
3 and
4 huck
5 asked
3 him
2 to
4 hold
2 on
1 a
6 minute
4 they
7 stepped
2 to
1 a
9 promising
4 nook
2 in
3 the
5 river
4 bank
3 and
5 threw
2 in
5 their
5 lines
6 almost
11 immediately
4 they
3 had
6 reward
3 joe
3 had
3 not
3 had
4 time
2 to
3 get
9 impatient
6 before
4 they
4 were
4 back
5 again
4 with
4 some
8 handsome
4 bass
1 a
6 couple
2 of
3 sun
5 perch
3 and
1 a
5 small
7 catfish
10 provisions
6 enough
3 for
5 quite
1 a
6 family
4 they
5 fried
3 the
4 fish
4 with
3 the
5 bacon
3 and
4 were
10 astonished
3 for
2 no
4 fish
3 had
4 ever
6 seemed
2 so
9 delicious
6 before
4 they
3 did
3 not
4 know
4 that
3 the
7 quicker
1 a
5 fresh
5 water
4 fish
2 is
2 on
3 the
4 fire
5 after
2 he
2 is
6 caught
3 the
6 better
2 he
2 is
3 and
4 they
9 reflected
6 little
4 upon
4 what
1 a
5 sauce
4 open
3 air
8 sleeping
4 open
3 air
8 exercise
7 bathing
3 and
1 a
5 large
10 ingredient
2 of
6 hunger
4 make
3 too
4 they
3 lay
6 around
2 in
3 the
5 shade
5 after
9 breakfast
5 while
4 huck
3 had
1 a
5 smoke
3 and
4 then
4 went
3 off
7 through
3 the
5 woods
2 on
2 an
9 exploring
10 expedition
4 they
7 tramped
5 gayly
5 along
4 over
8 decaying
4 logs
7 through
7 tangled
10 underbrush
5 among
6 solemn
8 monarchs
2 of
3 the
6 forest
4 hung
4 from
5 their
6 crowns
2 to
3 the
6 ground
4 with
1 a
8 drooping
7 regalia
2 of
5 grape
5 vines
3 now
3 and
4 then
4 they
4 came
4 upon
4 snug
5 nooks
8 carpeted
4 with
5 grass
3 and
7 jeweled
4 with
7 flowers
4 they
5 found
6 plenty
2 of
6 things
2 to
2 be
9 delighted
4 with
3 but
7 nothing
2 to
2 be
10 astonished
2 at
4 they
10 discovered
4 that
3 the
6 island
3 was
5 about
5 three
5 miles
4 long
3 and
1 a
7 quarter
2 of
1 a
4 mile
4 wide
3 and
4 that
3 the
5 shore
2 it
3 lay
7 closest
2 to
3 was
4 only
9 separated
4 from
2 it
2 by
1 a
6 narrow
7 channel
6 hardly
3 two
7 hundred
5 yards
4 wide
4 they
4 took
1 a
4 swim
5 about
5 every
4 hour
2 so
2 it
3 was
5 close
4 upon
3 the
6 middle
2 of
3 the
9 afternoon
4 when
4 they
3 got
4 back
2 to
4 camp
4 they
4 were
3 too
6 hungry
2 to
4 stop
2 to
4 fish
3 but
4 they
5 fared
11 sumptuously
4 upon
4 cold
3 ham
3 and
4 then
5 threw
10 themselves
4 down
2 in
3 the
5 shade
2 to
4 talk
3 but
3 the
4 talk
4 soon
5 began
2 to
4 drag
3 and
4 then
4 died
3 the
9 stillness
3 the
9 solemnity
4 that
7 brooded
2 in
3 the
5 woods
3 and
3 the
5 sense
2 of
10 loneliness
5 began
2 to
4 tell
4 upon
3 the
7 spirits
2 of
3 the
4 boys
4 they
4 fell
2 to
8 thinking
1 a
4 sort
2 of
9 undefined
7 longing
5 crept
4 upon
4 them
4 this
4 took
3 dim
5 shape
9 presently
2 it
3 was
7 budding
12 homesickness
4 even
4 finn
3 the
3 red
6 handed
3 was
8 dreaming
2 of
3 his
9 doorsteps
3 and
5 empty
9 hogsheads
3 but
4 they
4 were
3 all
7 ashamed
2 of
5 their
8 weakness
3 and
4 none
3 was
5 brave
6 enough
2 to
5 speak
3 his
7 thought
3 for
4 some
4 time
3 now
3 the
4 boys
3 had
4 been
5 dully
9 conscious
2 of
1 a
8 peculiar
5 sound
2 in
3 the
8 distance
4 just
2 as
3 one
9 sometimes
2 is
2 of
3 the
7 ticking
2 of
1 a
5 clock
5 which
2 he
5 takes
2 no
8 distinct
4 note
2 of
3 but
3 now
4 this
10 mysterious
5 sound
6 became
4 more
10 pronounced
3 and
6 forced
1 a
11 recognition
3 the
4 boys
7 started
7 glanced
2 at
4 each
5 other
3 and
4 then
4 each
7 assumed
1 a
9 listening
8 attitude
5 there
3 was
1 a
4 long
7 silence
8 profound
3 and
8 unbroken
4 then
1 a
4 deep
6 sullen
4 boom
4 came
8 floating
4 down
3 out
2 of
3 the
8 distance
4 what
2 is
2 it
9 exclaimed
3 joe
5 under
3 his
6 breath

3 tom
6 listen
3 don
1 t
4 talk
4 they
6 waited
1 a
4 time
4 that
6 seemed
2 an
3 age
3 and
4 then
3 the
4 same
7 muffled
4 boom
8 troubled
3 the
6 solemn
4 hush
3 let
1 s
2 go
3 and
3 see
4 they
6 sprang
2 to
5 their
4 feet
3 and
7 hurried
2 to
3 the
5 shore
6 toward
3 the
4 town
4 they
6 parted
3 the
6 bushes
2 on
3 the
4 bank
3 and
6 peered
3 out
4 over
3 the
5 water
3 the
6 little
5 steam
9 ferryboat
3 was
5 about
1 a
4 mile
5 below
3 the
7 village
8 drifting
4 with
3 the
7 current
3 her
5 broad
4 deck
6 seemed
7 crowded
4 with
6 people
5 there
4 were
1 a
5 great
4 many
6 skiffs
6 rowing
5 about
2 or
8 floating
4 with
3 the
6 stream
2 in
3 the
12 neighborhood
2 of
3 the
9 ferryboat
3 but
3 the
4 boys
5 could
3 not
9 determine
4 what
3 the
3 men
2 in
4 them
4 were
5 doing
9 presently
1 a
5 great
3 jet
2 of
5 white
5 smoke
5 burst
4 from
3 the
9 ferryboat
1 s
4 side
3 and
2 as
2 it
8 expanded
3 and
4 rose
2 in
1 a
4 lazy
5 cloud
4 that
4 same
4 dull
5 throb
2 of
5 sound
3 was
5 borne
2 to
3 the
9 listeners
5 again

6 agreed
4 that
5 there

3 tom
4 said
7 because
2 an
8 ignorant
4 lump
2 of

12 uninstructed
2 by
2 an
11 incantation
5 could
3 not

7 watched
9 presently
1 a
9 revealing
7 thought
7 flashed
7 through
3 tom
1 s
4 mind
3 and
2 he
9 exclaimed
4 boys
1 i

1 a
8 gorgeous
7 triumph
4 they
4 were
6 missed
4 they
4 were
7 mourned
6 hearts
4 were
8 breaking
2 on
5 their

5 tears
4 were
5 being
4 shed
8 accusing
8 memories
2 of
10 unkindness
2 to
5 these
4 poor
4 lost
4 lads
4 were
6 rising
2 up
3 and
10 unavailing
7 regrets
3 and
7 remorse
4 were
5 being
8 indulged
3 and
4 best
2 of
3 all
3 the
8 departed
4 were
3 the
4 talk
2 of
3 the
5 whole
4 town
3 and
3 the
4 envy
2 of
3 all
3 the
4 boys
2 as
3 far
2 as
4 this
8 dazzling
9 notoriety
3 was
9 concerned
4 this
3 was
4 fine
2 it
3 was
5 worth
5 while
2 to
2 be
1 a
6 pirate
5 after
3 all
2 as
8 twilight
4 drew
2 on
3 the
9 ferryboat
4 went
4 back
2 to
3 her
10 accustomed
8 business
3 and
3 the
6 skiffs
11 disappeared
3 the
7 pirates
8 returned
2 to
4 camp
4 they
4 were
8 jubilant
4 with
6 vanity
4 over
5 their
3 new
8 grandeur
3 and
3 the
11 illustrious
7 trouble
4 they
4 were
6 making
4 they
6 caught
4 fish
6 cooked
6 supper
3 and
3 ate
2 it
3 and
4 then
4 fell
2 to
8 guessing
2 at
4 what
3 the
7 village
3 was
8 thinking
3 and
6 saying
5 about
4 them
3 and
3 the
8 pictures
4 they
4 drew
2 of
3 the
6 public
8 distress
2 on
5 their
7 account
4 were
10 gratifying
2 to
4 look
4 upon
4 from
5 their
5 point
2 of
4 view
3 but
4 when
3 the
7 shadows
2 of
5 night
6 closed
4 them
2 in
4 they
9 gradually
6 ceased
2 to
4 talk
3 and
3 sat
6 gazing
4 into
3 the
4 fire
4 with
5 their
5 minds
9 evidently
9 wandering
9 elsewhere
3 the
10 excitement
3 was
4 gone
3 now
3 and
3 tom
3 and
3 joe
5 could
3 not
4 keep
4 back
8 thoughts
2 of
7 certain
7 persons
2 at
4 home
3 who
4 were
3 not
8 enjoying
4 this
4 fine
6 frolic
2 as
4 much
2 as
4 they
4 were
10 misgivings
4 came
4 they
4 grew
8 troubled
3 and
7 unhappy
1 a
4 sigh
2 or
3 two
7 escaped
8 unawares
2 by
3 and
2 by
3 joe
7 timidly
8 ventured
4 upon
1 a
10 roundabout
6 feeler
2 as
2 to
3 how
3 the
6 others
5 might
4 look
4 upon
1 a
6 return
2 to
12 civilization
3 not
5 right
3 now
3 but
3 tom
8 withered
3 him
4 with
8 derision
4 huck
5 being
11 uncommitted
2 as
3 yet
6 joined
2 in
4 with
3 tom
3 and
3 the
7 waverer
7 quickly
9 explained
3 and
3 was
4 glad
2 to
3 get
3 out
2 of
3 the
6 scrape
4 with
2 as
6 little
5 taint
2 of
7 chicken
7 hearted
12 homesickness
8 clinging
2 to
3 his
8 garments
2 as
2 he
5 could
6 mutiny
3 was
11 effectually
4 laid
2 to
4 rest
3 for
3 the
6 moment
2 as
3 the
5 night
8 deepened
4 huck
5 began
2 to
3 nod
3 and
9 presently
2 to
5 snore
3 joe
8 followed
4 next
3 tom
3 lay
4 upon
3 his
5 elbow
10 motionless
3 for
4 some
4 time
8 watching
3 the
3 two
8 intently
2 at
4 last
2 he
3 got
2 up
10 cautiously
2 on
3 his
5 knees
3 and
4 went
9 searching
5 among
3 the
5 grass
3 and
3 the
10 flickering
11 reflections
5 flung
2 by
3 the
4 camp
4 fire
2 he
6 picked
2 up
3 and
9 inspected
7 several
5 large
4 semi
9 cylinders
2 of
3 the
4 thin
5 white
4 bark
2 of
1 a
8 sycamore
3 and
7 finally
5 chose
3 two
5 which
6 seemed
2 to
4 suit
3 him
4 then
2 he
5 knelt
2 by
3 the
4 fire
3 and
9 painfully
5 wrote
9 something
4 upon
4 each
2 of
5 these
4 with
3 his
3 red
4 keel
3 one
2 he
6 rolled
2 up
3 and
3 put
2 in
3 his
6 jacket
6 pocket
3 and
3 the
5 other
2 he
3 put
2 in
3 joe
1 s
3 hat
3 and
7 removed
2 it
2 to
1 a
6 little
8 distance
4 from
3 the
5 owner
3 and
2 he
4 also
3 put
4 into
3 the
3 hat
7 certain
9 schoolboy
9 treasures
2 of
6 almost
11 inestimable
5 value
5 among
4 them
1 a

2 he
7 tiptoed
3 his

10 cautiously
5 among

4 till
2 he
4 felt
4 that
2 he
3 was
3 out

1 a

2 to
4 swim
3 the
9 remaining
7 hundred
5 yards
2 he
4 swam
10 quartering
8 upstream
3 but
5 still
3 was
5 swept

6 rather
6 faster
4 than
2 he
3 had
8 expected
7 however
2 he
7 reached
3 the
5 shore
7 finally
3 and
7 drifted
5 along
4 till

9 following
3 the

1 s
5 stern
2 he
4 laid
7 himself
4 down
5 under

3 and
6 waited
7 panting
9 presently
3 the

6 ashore
2 in
3 the
4 dusk
7 landing
5 fifty
5 yards
10 downstream
3 out
2 of

4 then
2 he
7 pressed
6 gently
3 and
3 the

9 continued
7 pushing
10 cautiously
3 and
7 quaking
5 every

2 it
7 creaked
4 till
2 he
6 judged
2 he

3 tom
4 took
3 and
6 filled
3 the
3 cat
4 full
2 of
4 pain
6 killer
3 and
1 i
3 did

5 house
4 down
3 and
3 god
7 forgive
2 me
1 i
7 cracked
3 tom
1 s
4 head
4 with
2 my
7 thimble
4 poor
3 boy
4 poor
4 dead
3 boy
3 but
2 he
1 s
3 out
2 of
3 all
3 his
8 troubles
3 now
3 and
3 the
4 last
5 words
1 i
4 ever
5 heard
3 him
3 say
3 was
2 to
8 reproach
3 but
4 this
6 memory
3 was
3 too
4 much
3 for
3 the
3 old
4 lady
3 and
3 she
5 broke
8 entirely
4 down
3 tom
3 was
9 snuffling
3 now
7 himself
3 and
4 more
2 in
4 pity
2 of
7 himself
4 than
7 anybody
4 else
2 he
5 could
4 hear
4 mary
6 crying
3 and
7 putting
2 in
1 a
6 kindly
4 word
3 for
3 him
4 from
4 time
2 to
4 time
2 he
5 began
2 to
4 have
1 a
6 nobler
7 opinion
2 of
7 himself
4 than
4 ever
6 before
5 still
2 he
3 was
12 sufficiently
7 touched
2 by
3 his
4 aunt
1 s
5 grief
2 to
4 long
2 to
4 rush
3 out
4 from
5 under
3 the
3 bed
3 and
9 overwhelm
3 her
4 with
3 joy
3 and
3 the
10 theatrical
12 gorgeousness
2 of
3 the
5 thing
8 appealed
8 strongly
2 to
3 his
6 nature
3 too
3 but
2 he
8 resisted
3 and
3 lay
5 still
2 he
4 went
2 on
9 listening
3 and
8 gathered
2 by
4 odds
3 and
4 ends
4 that
2 it
3 was
11 conjectured
2 at
5 first
4 that
3 the
4 boys
3 had
3 got
7 drowned
5 while
6 taking
1 a
4 swim
4 then
3 the
5 small
4 raft
3 had
4 been
6 missed
4 next
7 certain
4 boys
4 said
3 the
7 missing
4 lads
3 had
8 promised
4 that
3 the
7 village
6 should
4 hear
9 something
4 soon
3 the
4 wise
5 heads
3 had
3 put
4 this
3 and
4 that
8 together
3 and
7 decided
4 that
3 the
4 lads
3 had
4 gone
3 off
2 on
4 that
4 raft
3 and
5 would
4 turn
2 up
2 at
3 the
4 next
4 town
5 below
9 presently
3 but
6 toward
4 noon
3 the
4 raft
3 had
4 been
5 found
6 lodged
7 against
3 the
8 missouri
5 shore
4 some
4 five
2 or
3 six
5 miles
5 below
3 the
7 village
3 and
4 then
4 hope
8 perished
4 they
4 must
2 be
7 drowned
4 else
6 hunger
5 would
4 have
6 driven
4 them
4 home
2 by
9 nightfall
2 if
3 not
6 sooner
2 it
3 was
8 believed
4 that
3 the
6 search
3 for
3 the
6 bodies
3 had
4 been
1 a
9 fruitless
6 effort
6 merely
7 because
3 the
8 drowning
4 must
4 have
8 occurred
2 in
3 mid
7 channel
5 since
3 the
4 boys
5 being
4 good
8 swimmers
5 would
9 otherwise
4 have
7 escaped
2 to
5 shore
4 this
3 was
9 wednesday
5 night
2 if
3 the
6 bodies
9 continued
7 missing
5 until
6 sunday
3 all
4 hope
5 would
2 be
5 given
4 over
3 and
3 the
8 funerals
5 would
2 be
8 preached
2 on
4 that
7 morning
3 tom
9 shuddered
3 mrs
6 harper
4 gave
1 a
7 sobbing
4 good
5 night
3 and
6 turned
2 to
2 go
4 then
4 with
1 a
6 mutual
7 impulse
3 the
3 two
8 bereaved
5 women
5 flung
10 themselves
4 into
4 each
5 other
1 s
4 arms
3 and
3 had
1 a
4 good
9 consoling
3 cry
3 and
4 then
6 parted
4 aunt
5 polly
3 was
6 tender
3 far
6 beyond
3 her
4 wont
2 in
3 her
4 good
5 night
2 to
3 sid
3 and
4 mary
3 sid
8 snuffled
1 a
3 bit
3 and
4 mary
4 went
3 off
6 crying
4 with
3 all
3 her
5 heart
4 aunt
5 polly
5 knelt
4 down
3 and
6 prayed
3 for
3 tom
2 so
10 touchingly
2 so
11 appealingly
3 and
4 with
4 such
11 measureless
4 love
2 in
3 her
5 words
3 and
3 her
3 old
9 trembling
5 voice
4 that
2 he
3 was
9 weltering
2 in
5 tears
5 again
4 long
6 before
3 she
3 was
7 through
2 he
3 had
2 to
4 keep
5 still
4 long
5 after
3 she
4 went
2 to
3 bed
3 for
3 she
4 kept
6 making
6 broken
7 hearted
12 ejaculations
4 from
4 time
2 to
4 time
7 tossing
11 unrestfully
3 and
7 turning
4 over
3 but
2 at
4 last
3 she
3 was
5 still
4 only
7 moaning
1 a
6 little
2 in
3 her
5 sleep
3 now
3 the
3 boy
5 stole
3 out
4 rose
9 gradually
2 by
3 the
7 bedside
6 shaded
3 the
6 candle
5 light
4 with
3 his
4 hand
3 and
5 stood
9 regarding
3 her
3 his
5 heart
3 was
4 full
2 of
4 pity
3 for
3 her
2 he
4 took
3 out
3 his
8 sycamore
6 scroll
3 and
6 placed
2 it
2 by
3 the
6 candle
3 but
9 something
8 occurred
2 to
3 him
3 and
2 he
8 lingered
11 considering
3 his
4 face
7 lighted
4 with
1 a
5 happy
8 solution
2 of
3 his
7 thought
2 he
3 put
3 the
4 bark
7 hastily
2 in
3 his
6 pocket
4 then
2 he
4 bent
4 over
3 and
6 kissed
3 the
5 faded
4 lips
3 and
11 straightway
4 made
3 his
8 stealthy
4 exit
8 latching
3 the
4 door
6 behind
3 him
2 he
8 threaded
3 his
3 way
4 back
2 to
3 the
5 ferry
7 landing
5 found
6 nobody
2 at
5 large
5 there
3 and
6 walked
6 boldly
2 on
5 board
3 the
4 boat
3 for
2 he
4 knew
3 she
3 was
10 tenantless
6 except
4 that
5 there
3 was
1 a
8 watchman
3 who
6 always
6 turned
2 in
3 and
5 slept
4 like
1 a
6 graven
5 image
2 he
6 untied
3 the
5 skiff
2 at
3 the
5 stern
7 slipped
4 into
2 it
3 and
3 was
4 soon
6 rowing
10 cautiously
8 upstream
4 when
2 he
3 had
6 pulled
1 a
4 mile
5 above
3 the
7 village
2 he
7 started
10 quartering
6 across
3 and
4 bent
7 himself
7 stoutly
2 to
3 his
4 work
2 he
3 hit
3 the
7 landing
2 on
3 the
5 other
4 side
6 neatly
3 for
4 this
3 was
1 a
8 familiar
3 bit
2 of
4 work
2 to
3 him
2 he
3 was
5 moved
2 to
7 capture
3 the
5 skiff
7 arguing
4 that
2 it
5 might
2 be
10 considered
1 a
4 ship
3 and
9 therefore
10 legitimate
4 prey
3 for
1 a
6 pirate
3 but
2 he
4 knew
1 a
8 thorough
6 search
5 would
2 be
4 made
3 for
2 it
3 and
4 that
5 might
3 end
2 in
11 revelations
2 so
2 he
7 stepped
6 ashore
3 and
7 entered
3 the
5 woods
2 he
3 sat
4 down
3 and
4 took
1 a
4 long
4 rest
9 torturing
7 himself
9 meanwhile
2 to
4 keep
5 awake
3 and
4 then
7 started
6 warily
4 down
3 the
4 home
7 stretch
3 the
5 night
3 was
3 far
5 spent
2 it
3 was
5 broad
8 daylight
6 before
2 he
5 found
7 himself
6 fairly
7 abreast
3 the
6 island
3 bar
2 he
6 rested
5 again
5 until
3 the
3 sun
3 was
4 well
2 up
3 and
7 gilding
3 the
5 great
5 river
4 with
3 its
8 splendor
3 and
4 then
2 he
7 plunged
4 into
3 the
6 stream
1 a
6 little
5 later
2 he
6 paused
8 dripping
4 upon
3 the
9 threshold
2 of
3 the
4 camp

3 and
8 splashed
5 water
2 in
4 each
5 other
1 s
5 faces
4 with
5 their
5 palms
9 gradually
11 approaching
4 each

10 struggling
4 till

4 legs
3 and
4 arms
3 and
4 came
2 up
7 blowing
10 sputtering
8 laughing
3 and
7 gasping
3 for
6 breath
2 at
3 one
3 and
3 the
4 same
4 time
4 when
4 they
4 were
4 well
9 exhausted
4 they
5 would
3 run
3 out
3 and
6 sprawl
2 on
3 the
3 dry
3 hot
4 sand
3 and
3 lie
5 there
3 and
5 cover
10 themselves
2 up

3 for
3 the
5 water
5 again
3 and
2 go
7 through
3 the
8 original
11 performance
4 once
4 more
7 finally
2 it
8 occurred
2 to
4 them
4 that
5 their
5 naked
4 skin
11 represented
5 flesh
7 colored
6 tights
4 very
6 fairly
2 so
4 they
4 drew
1 a
4 ring
2 in
3 the
4 sand
3 and
3 had
1 a
6 circus
4 with
5 three
6 clowns
2 in
2 it
3 for
4 none
5 would
5 yield
4 this
8 proudest
4 post
2 to
3 his
8 neighbor
4 next
4 they
3 got
5 their
7 marbles
3 and
6 played
6 knucks
3 and
4 ring
3 taw
3 and
5 keeps
4 till
4 that
9 amusement
4 grew
5 stale
4 then
3 joe
3 and
4 huck
3 had
7 another
4 swim
3 but
3 tom
5 would
3 not
7 venture
7 because
2 he
5 found
4 that
2 in
7 kicking
3 off
3 his
8 trousers
2 he
3 had
6 kicked
3 his
6 string
2 of
11 rattlesnake
7 rattles
3 off
3 his
5 ankle
3 and
2 he
8 wondered
3 how
2 he
3 had
7 escaped
5 cramp
2 so
4 long
7 without
3 the
10 protection
2 of
4 this
10 mysterious
5 charm
2 he
3 did
3 not
7 venture
5 again
5 until
2 he
3 had
5 found
2 it
3 and
2 by
4 that
4 time
3 the
5 other
4 boys
4 were
5 tired
3 and
5 ready
2 to
4 rest
4 they
9 gradually
8 wandered
5 apart
7 dropped
4 into
3 the
5 dumps
3 and
4 fell
2 to
6 gazing
9 longingly
6 across
3 the
4 wide
5 river
2 to
5 where
3 the
7 village
3 lay
8 drowsing
2 in
3 the
3 sun
3 tom
5 found
7 himself
7 writing
5 becky
2 in
3 the
4 sand
4 with
3 his
3 big
3 toe
2 he
9 scratched
2 it
3 out
3 and
3 was
5 angry
4 with
7 himself
3 for
3 his
8 weakness
3 but
2 he
5 wrote
2 it
5 again
12 nevertheless
2 he
5 could
3 not
4 help
2 it
2 he
6 erased
2 it
4 once
4 more
3 and
4 then
4 took
7 himself
3 out
2 of
10 temptation
2 by
7 driving
3 the
5 other
4 boys
8 together
3 and
7 joining
4 them
3 but
3 joe
1 s
7 spirits
3 had
4 gone
4 down
6 almost
6 beyond
12 resurrection
2 he
3 was
2 so
8 homesick
4 that
2 he
5 could
6 hardly
6 endure
3 the
6 misery
2 of
2 it
3 the
5 tears
3 lay
4 very
4 near
3 the
7 surface
4 huck
3 was
10 melancholy
3 too
3 tom
3 was
11 downhearted
3 but
5 tried
4 hard
3 not
2 to
4 show
2 it
2 he
3 had
1 a
6 secret
5 which
2 he
3 was
3 not
5 ready
2 to
4 tell
3 yet
3 but
2 if
4 this
8 mutinous
10 depression
3 was
3 not
6 broken
2 up
4 soon
2 he
5 would
4 have
2 to
5 bring
2 it
3 out
2 he
4 said
4 with
1 a
5 great
4 show
2 of
12 cheerfulness

2 it
6 roused
4 only
5 faint
10 enthusiasm
5 which
5 faded
3 out

3 one
2 or
3 two
5 other
10 seductions
3 but
4 they
6 failed
3 too

1 s
3 all
4 huck
7 started
11 sorrowfully
4 away
3 and
3 tom
5 stood
7 looking
5 after
3 him
4 with
1 a
6 strong
6 desire
7 tugging
2 at
3 his
5 heart
2 to
5 yield
3 his
5 pride
3 and
2 go
5 along
3 too
2 he
5 hoped
3 the
4 boys
5 would
4 stop
3 but
4 they
5 still
5 waded
6 slowly
2 on
2 it
8 suddenly
6 dawned
2 on
3 tom
4 that
2 it
3 was
6 become
4 very
6 lonely
3 and
5 still
2 he
4 made
3 one
5 final
8 struggle
4 with
3 his
5 pride
3 and
4 then
6 darted
5 after
3 his
8 comrades
7 yelling
4 wait
4 wait
1 i
4 want
2 to
4 tell
3 you
9 something
4 they
9 presently
7 stopped
3 and
6 turned
6 around
4 when
2 he
3 got
2 to
5 where
4 they
4 were
2 he
5 began
9 unfolding
3 his
6 secret
3 and
4 they
8 listened
7 moodily
4 till
2 at
4 last
4 they
3 saw
3 the
5 point
2 he
3 was
7 driving
2 at
3 and
4 then
4 they
3 set
2 up
1 a
3 war
5 whoop
2 of
8 applause
3 and
4 said
2 it
3 was
8 splendid
3 and
4 said
2 if
2 he
3 had
4 told
4 them
2 at
5 first
4 they
6 wouldn
1 t
4 have
7 started
4 away
2 he
4 made
1 a
9 plausible
6 excuse
3 but
3 his
4 real
6 reason
3 had
4 been
3 the
4 fear
4 that
3 not
4 even
3 the
6 secret
5 would
4 keep
4 them
4 with
3 him
3 any
4 very
5 great
6 length
2 of
4 time
3 and
2 so
2 he
3 had
5 meant
2 to
4 hold
2 it
2 in
7 reserve
2 as
1 a
4 last
9 seduction
3 the
4 lads
4 came
5 gayly
4 back
3 and
4 went
2 at
5 their
6 sports
5 again
4 with
1 a
4 will
10 chattering
3 all
3 the
4 time
5 about
3 tom
1 s
10 stupendous
4 plan
3 and
8 admiring
3 the
6 genius
2 of
2 it
5 after
1 a
6 dainty
3 egg
3 and
4 fish
6 dinner
3 tom
4 said
2 he
6 wanted
2 to
5 learn
2 to
5 smoke
3 now
3 joe
6 caught
2 at
3 the
4 idea
3 and
4 said
2 he
5 would
4 like
2 to
3 try
3 too

4 huck
4 made
5 pipes
3 and
6 filled
4 them
5 these
7 novices
3 had
5 never
6 smoked
8 anything
6 before
3 but
6 cigars
4 made
2 of
5 grape
4 vine
3 and
4 they
3 bit
3 the
6 tongue
3 and
4 were
3 not
10 considered
5 manly
6 anyway
3 now
4 they
9 stretched
10 themselves
3 out
2 on
5 their
6 elbows
3 and
5 began
2 to
4 puff
7 charily
3 and
4 with
7 slender
10 confidence
3 the
5 smoke
3 had
2 an
10 unpleasant
5 taste
3 and
4 they
6 gagged
1 a
6 little
3 but
3 tom
4 said
3 why

2 to
4 flag
1 a
6 trifle
3 and
4 grow
10 disjointed
3 the
8 silences
7 widened
3 the
13 expectoration
12 marvellously
9 increased
5 every
4 pore
6 inside
3 the
4 boys
6 cheeks
6 became
1 a
8 spouting
8 fountain
4 they
5 could
8 scarcely
4 bail
3 out
3 the
7 cellars
5 under
5 their
7 tongues
4 fast
6 enough
2 to
7 prevent
2 an
10 inundation
6 little
12 overflowings
4 down
5 their
7 throats
8 occurred
2 in
5 spite
2 of
3 all
4 they
5 could
2 do
3 and
6 sudden
9 retchings
8 followed
5 every
4 time
4 both
4 boys
4 were
7 looking
4 very
4 pale
3 and
9 miserable
3 now
3 joe
1 s
4 pipe
7 dropped
4 from
3 his
9 nerveless
7 fingers
3 tom
1 s
8 followed
4 both
9 fountains

5 going
9 furiously
3 and
4 both
5 pumps
7 bailing
4 with
5 might
3 and
4 main

2 so
4 huck
3 sat
4 down
5 again
3 and
6 waited
2 an
4 hour
4 then
2 he
5 found
2 it
8 lonesome
3 and
4 went
2 to
4 find
3 his
8 comrades
4 they
4 were
4 wide
5 apart
2 in
3 the
5 woods
4 both
4 very
4 pale
4 both
4 fast
6 asleep
3 but
9 something
8 informed
3 him
4 that
2 if
4 they
3 had
3 had
3 any
7 trouble
4 they
3 had
3 got
3 rid
2 of
2 it
4 they
4 were
3 not
9 talkative
2 at
6 supper
4 that
5 night
4 they
3 had
1 a
6 humble
4 look
3 and
4 when
4 huck
8 prepared
3 his
4 pipe
5 after
3 the
4 meal
3 and
3 was
5 going
2 to
7 prepare
6 theirs
4 they
4 said
2 no
4 they
4 were
3 not
7 feeling
4 very
4 well
9 something
4 they
3 ate
2 at
6 dinner
3 had
9 disagreed
4 with
4 them
5 about
8 midnight
3 joe
5 awoke
3 and
6 called
3 the
4 boys
5 there
3 was
1 a
8 brooding
14 oppressiveness
2 in
3 the
3 air
4 that
6 seemed
2 to
4 bode
9 something
3 the
4 boys
7 huddled
10 themselves
8 together
3 and
6 sought
3 the
8 friendly
13 companionship
2 of
3 the
4 fire
6 though
3 the
4 dull
4 dead
4 heat
2 of
3 the
10 breathless
10 atmosphere
3 was
8 stifling
4 they
3 sat
5 still
6 intent
3 and
7 waiting
3 the
6 solemn
4 hush
9 continued
6 beyond
3 the
5 light
2 of
3 the
4 fire
10 everything
3 was
9 swallowed
2 up
2 in
3 the
9 blackness
2 of
8 darkness
9 presently
5 there
4 came
1 a
9 quivering
4 glow
4 that
7 vaguely
8 revealed
3 the
7 foliage
3 for
1 a
6 moment
3 and
4 then
8 vanished
2 by
3 and
2 by
7 another
4 came
1 a
6 little
8 stronger
4 then
7 another
4 then
1 a
5 faint
4 moan
4 came
7 sighing
7 through
3 the
8 branches
2 of
3 the
6 forest
3 and
3 the
4 boys
4 felt
1 a
8 fleeting
6 breath
4 upon
5 their
6 cheeks
3 and
9 shuddered
4 with
3 the
5 fancy
4 that
3 the
6 spirit
2 of
3 the
5 night
3 had
4 gone
2 by
5 there
3 was
1 a
5 pause
3 now
1 a
5 weird
5 flash
6 turned
5 night
4 into
3 day
3 and
6 showed
5 every
6 little
5 grass
5 blade
8 separate
3 and
8 distinct
4 that
4 grew
5 about
5 their
4 feet
3 and
2 it
6 showed
5 three
5 white
8 startled
5 faces
3 too
1 a
4 deep
4 peal
2 of
7 thunder
4 went
7 rolling
3 and
8 tumbling
4 down
3 the
7 heavens
3 and
4 lost
6 itself
2 in
6 sullen
9 rumblings
2 in
3 the
8 distance
1 a
5 sweep
2 of
6 chilly
3 air
6 passed
2 by
8 rustling
3 all
3 the
6 leaves
3 and
7 snowing
3 the
5 flaky
5 ashes
9 broadcast
5 about
3 the
4 fire
7 another
6 fierce
5 glare
3 lit
2 up
3 the
6 forest
3 and
2 an
7 instant
5 crash
8 followed
4 that
6 seemed
2 to
4 rend
3 the
4 tree
4 tops
5 right
4 over
3 the
4 boys
5 heads
4 they
5 clung
8 together
2 in
6 terror
2 in
3 the
5 thick
5 gloom
4 that
8 followed
1 a
3 few
3 big
4 rain
5 drops
4 fell
9 pattering
4 upon
3 the
6 leaves
5 quick
4 boys
2 go
3 for
3 the
4 tent
9 exclaimed
3 tom
4 they
6 sprang
4 away
9 stumbling
4 over
5 roots
3 and
5 among
5 vines
2 in
3 the
4 dark
2 no
3 two
8 plunging
2 in
3 the
4 same
9 direction
1 a
7 furious
5 blast
6 roared
7 through
3 the
5 trees
6 making
10 everything
4 sing
2 as
2 it
4 went
3 one
8 blinding
5 flash
5 after
7 another
4 came
3 and
4 peal
2 on
4 peal
2 of
9 deafening
7 thunder
3 and
3 now
1 a
9 drenching
4 rain
6 poured
4 down
3 and
3 the
6 rising
9 hurricane
5 drove
2 it
2 in
6 sheets
5 along
3 the
6 ground
3 the
4 boys
5 cried
3 out
2 to
4 each
5 other
3 but
3 the
7 roaring
4 wind
3 and
3 the
7 booming
7 thunder
6 blasts
7 drowned
5 their
6 voices
7 utterly
7 however
3 one
2 by
3 one
4 they
9 straggled
2 in
2 at
4 last
3 and
4 took
7 shelter
5 under
3 the
4 tent
4 cold
6 scared
3 and
9 streaming
4 with
5 water
3 but
2 to
4 have
7 company
2 in
6 misery
6 seemed
9 something
2 to
2 be
8 grateful
3 for
4 they
5 could
3 not
4 talk
3 the
3 old
4 sail
7 flapped
2 so
9 furiously
4 even
2 if
3 the
5 other
6 noises
5 would
4 have
7 allowed
4 them
3 the
7 tempest
4 rose
6 higher
3 and
6 higher
3 and
9 presently
3 the
4 sail
4 tore
5 loose
4 from
3 its
10 fastenings
3 and
4 went
7 winging
4 away
2 on
3 the
5 blast
3 the
4 boys
6 seized
4 each
6 others
5 hands
3 and
4 fled
4 with
4 many
9 tumblings
3 and
7 bruises
2 to
3 the
7 shelter
2 of
1 a
5 great
3 oak
4 that
5 stood
4 upon
3 the
5 river
4 bank
3 now
3 the
6 battle
3 was
2 at
3 its
7 highest
5 under
3 the
9 ceaseless
13 conflagration
2 of
9 lightning
4 that
6 flamed
2 in
3 the
5 skies
10 everything
5 below
5 stood
3 out
2 in
5 clean
3 cut
3 and
10 shadowless
12 distinctness
3 the
7 bending
5 trees
3 the
7 billowy
5 river
5 white
4 with
4 foam
3 the
7 driving
5 spray
2 of
5 spume
6 flakes
3 the
3 dim
8 outlines
2 of
3 the
4 high
6 bluffs
2 on
3 the
5 other
4 side
8 glimpsed
7 through
3 the
8 drifting
5 cloud
4 rack
3 and
3 the
8 slanting
4 veil
2 of
4 rain
5 every
6 little
5 while
4 some
5 giant
4 tree
7 yielded
3 the
5 fight
3 and
4 fell
8 crashing
7 through
3 the
7 younger
6 growth
3 and
3 the
10 unflagging
7 thunder
5 peals
4 came
3 now
2 in
3 ear
9 splitting
9 explosive
6 bursts
4 keen
3 and
5 sharp
3 and
11 unspeakably
9 appalling
3 the
5 storm
10 culminated
2 in
3 one
9 matchless
6 effort
4 that
6 seemed
6 likely
2 to
4 tear
3 the
6 island
2 to
6 pieces
4 burn
2 it
2 up
5 drown
2 it
2 to
3 the
4 tree
4 tops
4 blow
2 it
4 away
3 and
6 deafen
5 every
8 creature
2 in
2 it
3 all
2 at
3 one
3 and
3 the
4 same
6 moment
2 it
3 was
1 a
4 wild
5 night
3 for
8 homeless
5 young
5 heads
2 to
2 be
3 out
2 in
3 but
2 at
4 last
3 the
6 battle
3 was
4 done
3 and
3 the
6 forces
7 retired
4 with
6 weaker
3 and
6 weaker
12 threatenings
3 and
10 grumblings
3 and
5 peace
7 resumed
3 her
4 sway
3 the
4 boys
4 went
4 back
2 to
4 camp
1 a
4 good
4 deal
4 awed
3 but
4 they
5 found
5 there
3 was
5 still
9 something
2 to
2 be
8 thankful
3 for
7 because
3 the
5 great
8 sycamore
3 the
7 shelter
2 of
5 their
4 beds
3 was
1 a
4 ruin
3 now
7 blasted
2 by
3 the
10 lightnings
3 and
4 they
4 were
3 not
5 under
2 it
4 when
3 the
11 catastrophe
8 happened
10 everything
2 in
4 camp
3 was
8 drenched
3 the
4 camp
4 fire
2 as
4 well
3 for
4 they
4 were
3 but
8 heedless
4 lads
4 like
5 their
10 generation
3 and
3 had
4 made
2 no
9 provision
7 against
4 rain
4 here
3 was
6 matter
3 for
6 dismay
3 for
4 they
4 were
6 soaked
7 through
3 and
7 chilled
4 they
4 were
8 eloquent
2 in
5 their
8 distress
3 but
4 they
9 presently
10 discovered
4 that
3 the
4 fire
3 had
5 eaten
2 so
3 far
2 up
5 under
3 the
5 great
3 log
2 it
3 had
4 been
5 built
7 against
5 where
2 it
6 curved
6 upward
3 and
9 separated
6 itself
4 from
3 the
6 ground
4 that
1 a
11 handbreadth
2 or
2 so
2 of
2 it
3 had
7 escaped
7 wetting
2 so
4 they
9 patiently
7 wrought
5 until
4 with
6 shreds
3 and
4 bark
8 gathered
4 from
3 the
5 under
5 sides
2 of
9 sheltered
4 logs
4 they
6 coaxed
3 the
4 fire
2 to
4 burn
5 again
4 then
4 they
5 piled
2 on
5 great
4 dead
6 boughs
4 till
4 they
3 had
1 a
7 roaring
7 furnace
3 and
4 were
4 glad
7 hearted
4 once
4 more
4 they
5 dried
5 their
6 boiled
3 ham
3 and
3 had
1 a
5 feast
3 and
5 after
4 that
4 they
3 sat
2 by
3 the
4 fire
3 and
8 expanded
3 and
9 glorified
5 their
8 midnight
9 adventure
5 until
7 morning
3 for
5 there
3 was
3 not
1 a
3 dry
4 spot
2 to
5 sleep
2 on
8 anywhere
6 around
2 as
3 the
3 sun
5 began
2 to
5 steal
2 in
4 upon
3 the
4 boys
10 drowsiness
4 came
4 over
4 them
3 and
4 they
4 went
3 out
2 on
3 the
7 sandbar
3 and
3 lay
4 down
2 to
5 sleep
4 they
3 got
8 scorched
3 out
2 by
3 and
2 by
3 and
8 drearily
3 set
5 about
7 getting
9 breakfast
5 after
3 the
4 meal
4 they
4 felt
5 rusty
3 and
5 stiff
7 jointed
3 and
1 a
6 little
8 homesick
4 once
4 more
3 tom
3 saw
3 the
5 signs
3 and
4 fell
2 to
8 cheering
2 up
3 the
7 pirates
2 as
4 well
2 as
2 he
5 could
3 but
4 they
5 cared
7 nothing
3 for
7 marbles
2 or
6 circus
2 or
8 swimming
2 or
8 anything
2 he
8 reminded
4 them
2 of
3 the
8 imposing
6 secret
3 and
6 raised
1 a
3 ray
2 of
5 cheer
5 while
2 it
6 lasted
2 he
3 got
4 them
10 interested
2 in
1 a
3 new
6 device
4 this
3 was
2 to
5 knock
3 off
5 being
7 pirates
3 for
1 a
5 while
3 and
2 be
7 indians
3 for
1 a
6 change
4 they
4 were
9 attracted
2 by
4 this
4 idea
2 so
2 it
3 was
3 not
4 long
6 before
4 they
4 were
8 stripped
3 and
7 striped
4 from
4 head
2 to
4 heel
4 with
5 black
3 mud
4 like
2 so
4 many
6 zebras
3 all
2 of
4 them
6 chiefs
2 of
6 course
3 and
4 then
4 they
4 went
7 tearing
7 through
3 the
5 woods
2 to
6 attack
2 an
7 english
10 settlement
2 by
3 and
2 by
4 they
9 separated
4 into
5 three
7 hostile
6 tribes
3 and
6 darted
4 upon
4 each
5 other
4 from
6 ambush
4 with
8 dreadful
3 war
6 whoops
3 and
6 killed
3 and
7 scalped
4 each
5 other
2 by
9 thousands
2 it
3 was
1 a
4 gory
3 day
12 consequently
2 it
3 was
2 an
9 extremely
12 satisfactory
3 one
4 they
9 assembled
2 in
4 camp
6 toward
6 supper
4 time
6 hungry
3 and
5 happy
3 but
3 now
1 a
10 difficulty
5 arose
7 hostile
7 indians
5 could
3 not
5 break
3 the
5 bread
2 of
11 hospitality
8 together
7 without
5 first
6 making
5 peace
3 and
4 this
3 was
1 a
6 simple
13 impossibility
7 without
7 smoking
1 a
4 pipe
2 of
5 peace
5 there
3 was
2 no
5 other
7 process
4 that
4 ever
4 they
3 had
5 heard
2 of
3 two
2 of
3 the
7 savages
6 almost
6 wished
4 they
3 had
8 remained
7 pirates
7 however
5 there
3 was
2 no
5 other
3 way
2 so
4 with
4 such
4 show
2 of
12 cheerfulness
2 as
4 they
5 could
6 muster
4 they
6 called
3 for
3 the
4 pipe
3 and
4 took
5 their
5 whiff
2 as
2 it
6 passed
2 in
3 due
4 form
3 and
6 behold
4 they
4 were
4 glad
4 they
3 had
4 gone
4 into
8 savagery
3 for
4 they
3 had
6 gained
9 something
4 they
5 found
4 that
4 they
5 could
3 now
5 smoke
1 a
6 little
7 without
6 having
2 to
2 go
3 and
4 hunt
3 for
1 a
4 lost
5 knife
4 they
3 did
3 not
3 get
4 sick
6 enough
2 to
2 be
9 seriously
13 uncomfortable
4 they
4 were
3 not
6 likely
2 to
4 fool
4 away
4 this
4 high
7 promise
3 for
4 lack
2 of
6 effort
2 no
4 they
9 practised
10 cautiously
5 after
6 supper
4 with
5 right
4 fair
7 success
3 and
2 so
4 they
5 spent
1 a
8 jubilant
7 evening
4 they
4 were
7 prouder
3 and
7 happier
2 in
5 their
3 new
11 acquirement
4 than
4 they
5 would
4 have
4 been
2 in
3 the
8 scalping
3 and
8 skinning
2 of
3 the
3 six
7 nations
2 we
4 will
5 leave
4 them
2 to
5 smoke
3 and
7 chatter
3 and
4 brag
5 since
2 we
4 have
2 no
7 further
3 use
3 for
4 them
2 at
7 present
7 chapter
4 xvii
3 but
5 there
3 was
2 no
8 hilarity
2 in
3 the
6 little
4 town
4 that
4 same
8 tranquil
8 saturday
9 afternoon
3 the
7 harpers
3 and
4 aunt
5 polly
1 s
6 family
4 were
5 being
3 put
4 into
8 mourning
4 with
5 great
5 grief
3 and
4 many
5 tears
2 an
7 unusual
5 quiet
9 possessed
3 the
7 village
8 although
2 it
3 was
10 ordinarily
5 quiet
6 enough
2 in
3 all
10 conscience
3 the
9 villagers
9 conducted
5 their
8 concerns
4 with
2 an
6 absent
3 air
3 and
6 talked
6 little
3 but
4 they
6 sighed
5 often
3 the
8 saturday
7 holiday
6 seemed
1 a
6 burden
2 to
3 the
8 children
4 they
3 had
2 no
5 heart
2 in
5 their
6 sports
3 and
9 gradually
4 gave
4 them
2 up
2 in
3 the
9 afternoon
5 becky
8 thatcher
5 found
7 herself
6 moping
5 about
3 the
8 deserted
11 schoolhouse
4 yard
3 and
7 feeling
4 very
10 melancholy
3 but
3 she
5 found
7 nothing
5 there
2 to
7 comfort
3 her
3 she
12 soliloquized
2 oh
2 if
1 i
4 only
3 had
1 a
5 brass
7 andiron
4 knob
5 again
3 but
1 i
5 haven
1 t
3 got
8 anything
3 now
2 to
8 remember
3 him
2 by
3 and
3 she
6 choked
4 back
1 a
6 little
3 sob
9 presently
3 she
7 stopped
3 and
4 said
2 to
7 herself
2 it
3 was
5 right
4 here
2 oh
2 if
2 it
3 was
2 to
2 do
4 over
5 again
1 i
6 wouldn
1 t
3 say
4 that
1 i
6 wouldn
1 t
3 say
2 it
3 for
3 the
5 whole
5 world
3 but
2 he
1 s
4 gone
3 now
1 i
2 ll
5 never
5 never
5 never
3 see
3 him
3 any
4 more
4 this
7 thought
5 broke
3 her
4 down
3 and
3 she
8 wandered
4 away
4 with
5 tears
7 rolling
4 down
3 her
6 cheeks
4 then
5 quite
1 a
5 group
2 of
4 boys
3 and
5 girls
9 playmates
2 of
3 tom
1 s
3 and
3 joe
1 s
4 came
2 by
3 and
5 stood
7 looking
4 over
3 the
6 paling
5 fence
3 and
7 talking
2 in
8 reverent
5 tones
2 of
3 how
3 tom
3 did
2 so
3 and
2 so
3 the
4 last
4 time
4 they
3 saw
3 him
3 and
3 how
3 joe
4 said
4 this
3 and
4 that
5 small
6 trifle
8 pregnant
4 with
5 awful
8 prophecy
2 as
4 they
5 could
6 easily
3 see
3 now
3 and
4 each
7 speaker
7 pointed
3 out
3 the
5 exact
4 spot
5 where
3 the
4 lost
4 lads
5 stood
2 at
3 the
4 time
3 and
4 then
5 added
9 something
4 like
3 and
1 i
3 was
1 a
8 standing
4 just
2 so
4 just
2 as
1 i
2 am
3 now
3 and
2 as
2 if
3 you
3 was
3 him
1 i
3 was
2 as
5 close
2 as
4 that
3 and
2 he
6 smiled
4 just
4 this
3 way
3 and
4 then
9 something
6 seemed
2 to
2 go
3 all
4 over
2 me
4 like
5 awful
3 you
4 know
3 and
1 i
5 never
7 thought
4 what
2 it
5 meant
2 of
6 course
3 but
1 i
3 can
3 see
3 now
4 then
5 there
3 was
1 a
7 dispute
5 about
3 who
3 saw
3 the
4 dead
4 boys
4 last
2 in
4 life
3 and
4 many
7 claimed
4 that
6 dismal
11 distinction
3 and
7 offered
9 evidences
4 more
2 or
4 less
8 tampered
4 with
2 by
3 the
7 witness
3 and
4 when
2 it
3 was
10 ultimately
7 decided
3 who
3 did
3 see
3 the
8 departed
4 last
3 and
9 exchanged
3 the
4 last
5 words
4 with
4 them
3 the
5 lucky
7 parties
4 took
4 upon
10 themselves
1 a
4 sort
2 of
6 sacred
10 importance
3 and
4 were
5 gaped
2 at
3 and
6 envied
2 by
3 all
3 the
4 rest
3 one
4 poor
4 chap
3 who
3 had
2 no
5 other
8 grandeur
2 to
5 offer
4 said
4 with
9 tolerably
8 manifest
5 pride
2 in
3 the
11 remembrance
4 well
3 tom
6 sawyer
2 he
6 licked
2 me
4 once
3 but
4 that
3 bid
3 for
5 glory
3 was
1 a
7 failure
4 most
2 of
3 the
4 boys
5 could
3 say
4 that
3 and
2 so
4 that
9 cheapened
3 the
11 distinction
3 too
4 much
3 the
5 group
8 loitered
4 away
5 still
9 recalling
8 memories
2 of
3 the
4 lost
6 heroes
2 in
4 awed
6 voices
4 when
3 the
6 sunday
6 school
4 hour
3 was
8 finished
3 the
4 next
7 morning
3 the
4 bell
5 began
2 to
4 toll
7 instead
2 of
7 ringing
2 in
3 the
5 usual
3 way
2 it
3 was
1 a
4 very
5 still
7 sabbath
3 and
3 the
8 mournful
5 sound
6 seemed
2 in
7 keeping
4 with
3 the
6 musing
4 hush
4 that
3 lay
4 upon
6 nature
3 the
9 villagers
5 began
2 to
6 gather
9 loitering
1 a
6 moment
2 in
3 the
9 vestibule
2 to
8 converse
2 in
8 whispers
5 about
3 the
3 sad
5 event
3 but
5 there
3 was
2 no
10 whispering
2 in
3 the
5 house
4 only
3 the
8 funereal
8 rustling
2 of
7 dresses
2 as
3 the
5 women
8 gathered
2 to
5 their
5 seats
9 disturbed
3 the
7 silence
5 there
4 none
5 could
8 remember
4 when
3 the
6 little
6 church
3 had
4 been
2 so
4 full
6 before
5 there
3 was
7 finally
1 a
7 waiting
5 pause
2 an
9 expectant
8 dumbness
3 and
4 then
4 aunt
5 polly
7 entered
8 followed
2 by
3 sid
3 and
4 mary
3 and
4 they
2 by
3 the
6 harper
6 family
3 all
2 in
4 deep
5 black
3 and
3 the
5 whole
12 congregation
3 the
3 old
8 minister
2 as
4 well
4 rose
10 reverently
3 and
5 stood
5 until
3 the
8 mourners
4 were
6 seated
2 in
3 the
5 front
3 pew
5 there
3 was
7 another
9 communing
7 silence
6 broken
2 at
9 intervals
2 by
7 muffled
4 sobs
3 and
4 then
3 the
8 minister
6 spread
3 his
5 hands
6 abroad
3 and
6 prayed
1 a
6 moving
4 hymn
3 was
4 sung
3 and
3 the
4 text
8 followed
1 i
2 am
3 the
12 resurrection
3 and
3 the
4 life
2 as
3 the
7 service
9 proceeded
3 the
9 clergyman
4 drew
4 such
8 pictures
2 of
3 the
6 graces
3 the
7 winning
4 ways
3 and
3 the
4 rare
7 promise
2 of
3 the
4 lost
4 lads
4 that
5 every
4 soul
5 there
8 thinking
2 he
10 recognized
5 these
8 pictures
4 felt
1 a
4 pang
2 in
11 remembering
4 that
2 he
3 had
12 persistently
7 blinded
7 himself
2 to
4 them
6 always
6 before
3 and
3 had
2 as
12 persistently
4 seen
4 only
6 faults
3 and
5 flaws
2 in
3 the
4 poor
4 boys
3 the
8 minister
7 related
4 many
1 a
8 touching
8 incident
2 in
3 the
5 lives
2 of
3 the
8 departed
3 too
5 which
11 illustrated
5 their
5 sweet
8 generous
7 natures
3 and
3 the
6 people
5 could
6 easily
3 see
3 now
3 how
5 noble
3 and
9 beautiful
5 those
8 episodes
4 were
3 and
10 remembered
4 with
5 grief
4 that
2 at
3 the
4 time
4 they
8 occurred
4 they
3 had
6 seemed
4 rank
11 rascalities
4 well
9 deserving
2 of
3 the
7 cowhide
3 the
12 congregation
6 became
4 more
3 and
4 more
5 moved
2 as
3 the
8 pathetic
4 tale
4 went
2 on
4 till
2 at
4 last
3 the
5 whole
7 company
5 broke
4 down
3 and
6 joined
3 the
7 weeping
8 mourners
2 in
1 a
6 chorus
2 of
9 anguished
4 sobs
3 the
8 preacher
7 himself
6 giving
3 way
2 to
3 his
8 feelings
3 and
6 crying
2 in
3 the
6 pulpit
5 there
3 was
1 a
6 rustle
2 in
3 the
7 gallery
5 which
6 nobody
7 noticed
1 a
6 moment
5 later
3 the
6 church
4 door
7 creaked
3 the
8 minister
6 raised
3 his
9 streaming
4 eyes
5 above
3 his
12 handkerchief
3 and
5 stood
10 transfixed
5 first
3 one
3 and
4 then
7 another
4 pair
2 of
4 eyes
8 followed
3 the
8 minister
1 s
3 and
4 then
6 almost
4 with
3 one
7 impulse
3 the
12 congregation
4 rose
3 and
6 stared
5 while
3 the
5 three
4 dead
4 boys
4 came
8 marching
2 up
3 the
5 aisle
3 tom
2 in
3 the

10 sheepishly
2 in

3 hid
2 in
3 the
6 unused
7 gallery
9 listening
2 to
5 their
3 own
7 funeral
6 sermon
4 aunt
5 polly
4 mary
3 and
3 the
7 harpers
5 threw
10 themselves
4 upon
5 their
8 restored
4 ones
9 smothered
4 them
4 with
6 kisses
3 and
6 poured
3 out
13 thanksgivings
5 while
4 poor
4 huck
5 stood
7 abashed
3 and
13 uncomfortable
3 not
7 knowing
7 exactly
4 what
2 to
2 do
2 or
5 where
2 to
4 hide
4 from
2 so
4 many
11 unwelcoming
4 eyes
2 he
7 wavered
3 and
7 started
2 to
5 slink
4 away

3 tom

10 motherless
5 thing
3 and
3 the
6 loving
10 attentions
4 aunt
5 polly
8 lavished
4 upon
3 him
4 were
3 the
3 one
5 thing
7 capable
2 of
6 making
3 him
4 more
13 uncomfortable
4 than
2 he
3 was
6 before
8 suddenly
3 the
8 minister
7 shouted
2 at

3 top
2 of
3 his
5 voice

3 her
7 realism
4 with
3 tom
1 s
10 marvellous
5 dream
3 sid
3 had
6 better
8 judgment
4 than
2 to
5 utter
3 the
7 thought
4 that
3 was
2 in
3 his
4 mind
2 as
2 he
4 left
3 the
5 house
2 it
3 was
4 this
6 pretty
4 thin
2 as
4 long
1 a
5 dream
2 as
4 that
7 without
3 any
8 mistakes
2 in
2 it
4 what
1 a
4 hero
3 tom
3 was
6 become
3 now
2 he
3 did
3 not
2 go
8 skipping
3 and
8 prancing
3 but
5 moved
4 with
1 a
9 dignified
7 swagger
2 as
6 became
1 a
6 pirate
3 who
4 felt
4 that
3 the
6 public
3 eye
3 was
2 on
3 him
3 and
6 indeed
2 it
3 was
2 he
5 tried
3 not
2 to
4 seem
2 to
3 see
3 the
5 looks
2 or
4 hear
3 the
7 remarks
2 as
2 he
6 passed
5 along
3 but
4 they
4 were
4 food
3 and
5 drink
2 to
3 him
7 smaller
4 boys
4 than
7 himself
7 flocked
2 at
3 his
5 heels
2 as
5 proud
2 to
2 be
4 seen
4 with
3 him
3 and
9 tolerated
2 by
3 him
2 as
2 if
2 he
3 had
4 been
3 the
7 drummer
2 at
3 the
4 head
2 of
1 a
10 procession
2 or
3 the
8 elephant
7 leading
1 a
9 menagerie
4 into
4 town
4 boys
2 of
3 his
3 own
4 size
9 pretended
3 not
2 to
4 know
2 he
3 had
4 been
4 away
2 at
3 all
3 but
4 they
4 were
9 consuming
4 with
4 envy
12 nevertheless
4 they
5 would
4 have
5 given
8 anything
2 to
4 have
4 that
7 swarthy
9 suntanned
4 skin
2 of
3 his
3 and
3 his
10 glittering
9 notoriety
3 and
3 tom
5 would
3 not
4 have
6 parted
4 with
6 either
3 for
1 a
6 circus
2 at
6 school
3 the
8 children
4 made
2 so
4 much
2 of
3 him
3 and
2 of
3 joe
3 and
9 delivered
4 such
8 eloquent
10 admiration
4 from
5 their
4 eyes
4 that
3 the
3 two
6 heroes
4 were
3 not
4 long
2 in
8 becoming
12 insufferably
5 stuck
2 up
4 they
5 began
2 to
4 tell
5 their
10 adventures
2 to
6 hungry
9 listeners
3 but
4 they
4 only
5 began
2 it
3 was
3 not
1 a
5 thing
6 likely
2 to
4 have
2 an
3 end
4 with
12 imaginations
4 like
6 theirs
2 to
7 furnish
8 material
3 and
7 finally
4 when
4 they
3 got
3 out
5 their
5 pipes
3 and
4 went
8 serenely
7 puffing
6 around
3 the
4 very
6 summit
2 of
5 glory
3 was
7 reached
3 tom
7 decided
4 that
2 he
5 could
2 be
11 independent
2 of
5 becky
8 thatcher
3 now
5 glory
3 was
10 sufficient
2 he
5 would
4 live
3 for
5 glory
3 now
4 that
2 he
3 was
13 distinguished
5 maybe
3 she
5 would
2 be
7 wanting
2 to
4 make
2 up
4 well
3 let
3 her
3 she
6 should
3 see
4 that
2 he
5 could
2 be
2 as
11 indifferent
2 as
4 some
5 other
6 people
9 presently
3 she
7 arrived
3 tom
9 pretended
3 not
2 to
3 see
3 her
2 he
5 moved
4 away
3 and
6 joined
1 a
5 group
2 of
4 boys
3 and
5 girls
3 and
5 began
2 to
4 talk
4 soon
2 he
8 observed
4 that
3 she
3 was
8 tripping
5 gayly
4 back
3 and
5 forth
4 with
7 flushed
4 face
3 and
7 dancing
4 eyes
10 pretending
2 to
2 be
4 busy
7 chasing
11 schoolmates
3 and
9 screaming
4 with
8 laughter
4 when
3 she
4 made
1 a
7 capture
3 but
2 he
7 noticed
4 that
3 she
6 always
4 made
3 her
8 captures
2 in
3 his
8 vicinity
3 and
4 that
3 she
6 seemed
2 to
4 cast
1 a
9 conscious
3 eye
2 in
3 his
9 direction
2 at
4 such
5 times
3 too
2 it
9 gratified
3 all
3 the
7 vicious
6 vanity
4 that
3 was
2 in
3 him
3 and
2 so
7 instead
2 of
7 winning
3 him
2 it
4 only
3 set
3 him
2 up
3 the
4 more
3 and
4 made
3 him
3 the
4 more
8 diligent
2 to
5 avoid
9 betraying
4 that
2 he
4 knew
3 she
3 was
5 about
9 presently
3 she
4 gave
4 over
10 skylarking
3 and
5 moved
12 irresolutely
5 about
7 sighing
4 once
2 or
5 twice
3 and
8 glancing
9 furtively
3 and
9 wistfully
6 toward
3 tom
4 then
3 she
8 observed
4 that
3 now
3 tom
3 was
7 talking
4 more
12 particularly
2 to
3 amy
8 lawrence
4 than
2 to
3 any
3 one
4 else
3 she
4 felt
1 a
5 sharp
4 pang
3 and
4 grew
9 disturbed
3 and
6 uneasy
2 at
4 once
3 she
5 tried
2 to
2 go
4 away
3 but
3 her
4 feet
4 were
11 treacherous
3 and
7 carried
3 her
2 to
3 the
5 group
7 instead
3 she
4 said
2 to
1 a
4 girl
6 almost
2 at
3 tom
1 s
5 elbow
4 with
4 sham
8 vivacity
3 why
4 mary

3 amy
8 lawrence
5 about
3 the
8 terrible
5 storm
2 on

2 on

2 of
6 joyful
5 hands
4 till
3 all
3 the
5 group
3 had
6 begged
3 for
11 invitations
3 but
3 tom
3 and
3 amy
4 then
3 tom
6 turned
6 coolly
4 away
5 still
7 talking
3 and
4 took
3 amy
4 with
3 him
5 becky
1 s
4 lips
8 trembled
3 and
3 the
5 tears
4 came
2 to
3 her
4 eyes
3 she
3 hid
5 these
5 signs
4 with
1 a
6 forced
6 gayety
3 and
4 went
2 on
10 chattering
3 but
3 the
4 life
3 had
4 gone
3 out
2 of
3 the
6 picnic
3 now
3 and
3 out
2 of
10 everything
4 else
3 she
3 got
4 away
2 as
4 soon
2 as
3 she
5 could
3 and
3 hid
7 herself
3 and
3 had
4 what
3 her
3 sex
4 call
1 a
4 good
3 cry
4 then
3 she
3 sat
5 moody
4 with
7 wounded
5 pride
4 till
3 the
4 bell
4 rang
3 she
6 roused
2 up
3 now
4 with
1 a
10 vindictive
4 cast
2 in
3 her
3 eye
3 and
4 gave
3 her
7 plaited
5 tails
1 a
5 shake
3 and
4 said
3 she
4 knew
4 what
3 she
1 d
2 do
2 at
6 recess
3 tom
9 continued
3 his
10 flirtation
4 with
3 amy
4 with
8 jubilant
4 self
12 satisfaction
3 and
2 he
4 kept
8 drifting
5 about
2 to
4 find
5 becky
3 and
8 lacerate
3 her
4 with
3 the
11 performance
2 at
4 last
2 he
5 spied
3 her
3 but
5 there
3 was
1 a
6 sudden
7 falling
2 of
3 his
7 mercury
3 she
3 was
7 sitting
6 cosily
2 on
1 a
6 little
5 bench
6 behind
3 the
11 schoolhouse
7 looking
2 at
1 a
7 picture
4 book
4 with
6 alfred
6 temple
3 and
2 so
8 absorbed
4 were
4 they
3 and
5 their
5 heads
2 so
5 close
8 together
4 over
3 the
4 book
4 that
4 they
3 did
3 not
4 seem
2 to
2 be
9 conscious
2 of
8 anything
2 in
3 the
5 world
7 besides
8 jealousy
3 ran
3 red
3 hot
7 through
3 tom
1 s
5 veins
2 he
5 began
2 to
4 hate
7 himself
3 for
8 throwing
4 away
3 the
6 chance
5 becky
3 had
7 offered
3 for
1 a
14 reconciliation
2 he
6 called
7 himself
1 a
4 fool
3 and
3 all
3 the
4 hard
5 names
2 he
5 could
5 think
2 of
2 he
6 wanted
2 to
3 cry
4 with
8 vexation
3 amy
7 chatted
7 happily
5 along
2 as
4 they
6 walked
3 for
3 her
5 heart
3 was
7 singing
3 but
3 tom
1 s
6 tongue
3 had
4 lost
3 its
8 function
2 he
3 did
3 not
4 hear
4 what
3 amy
3 was
6 saying
3 and
8 whenever
3 she
6 paused
11 expectantly
2 he
5 could
4 only
7 stammer
2 an
7 awkward
6 assent
5 which
3 was
2 as
5 often
9 misplaced
2 as
9 otherwise
2 he
4 kept
8 drifting
2 to
3 the
4 rear
2 of
3 the
11 schoolhouse
5 again
3 and
5 again
2 to
4 sear
3 his
8 eyeballs
4 with
3 the
7 hateful
9 spectacle
5 there
2 he
5 could
3 not
4 help
2 it
3 and
2 it
8 maddened
3 him
2 to
3 see
2 as
2 he
7 thought
2 he
3 saw
4 that
5 becky
8 thatcher
5 never
4 once
9 suspected
4 that
2 he
3 was
4 even
2 in
3 the
4 land
2 of
3 the
6 living
3 but
3 she
3 did
3 see
12 nevertheless
3 and
3 she
4 knew
3 she
3 was
7 winning
3 her
5 fight
3 too
3 and
3 was
4 glad
2 to
3 see
3 him
6 suffer
2 as
3 she
3 had
8 suffered
3 amy
1 s
5 happy
7 prattle
6 became
11 intolerable
3 tom
6 hinted
2 at
6 things
2 he
3 had
2 to
6 attend
2 to
6 things
4 that
4 must
2 be
4 done
3 and
4 time
3 was
8 fleeting
3 but
2 in
4 vain
3 the
4 girl
7 chirped
2 on
3 tom
7 thought
2 oh
4 hang
3 her
3 ain
1 t
1 i
4 ever
5 going
2 to
3 get
3 rid
2 of
3 her
2 at
4 last
2 he
4 must
2 be
9 attending
2 to
5 those
6 things
3 and
3 she
4 said
9 artlessly
4 that
3 she
5 would
2 be
6 around
4 when
6 school
3 let
3 out
3 and
2 he
8 hastened
4 away
6 hating
3 her
3 for
2 it
3 any
5 other
3 boy
3 tom
7 thought
7 grating
3 his
5 teeth
3 any
3 boy
2 in
3 the
5 whole
4 town
3 but
4 that
5 saint
5 louis
6 smarty
4 that
6 thinks
2 he
7 dresses
2 so
4 fine
3 and
2 is
11 aristocracy
2 oh
3 all
5 right
1 i
6 licked
3 you
3 the
5 first
3 day
3 you
4 ever
3 saw
4 this
4 town
6 mister
3 and
1 i
2 ll
4 lick
3 you
5 again
3 you
4 just
4 wait
4 till
1 i
5 catch
3 you
3 out
1 i
2 ll
4 just
4 take
3 and
3 and
2 he
4 went
7 through
3 the
7 motions
2 of
9 thrashing
2 an
9 imaginary
3 boy
10 pummelling
3 the
3 air
3 and
7 kicking
3 and
7 gouging
2 oh
3 you
2 do
2 do
3 you
3 you
6 holler
5 nough
2 do
3 you
3 now
4 then
3 let
4 that
5 learn
3 you
3 and
2 so
3 the
9 imaginary
8 flogging
3 was
8 finished
2 to
3 his
12 satisfaction
3 tom
4 fled
4 home
2 at
4 noon
3 his
10 conscience
5 could
3 not
6 endure
3 any
4 more
2 of
3 amy
1 s
8 grateful
9 happiness
3 and
3 his
8 jealousy
5 could
4 bear
2 no
4 more
2 of
3 the
5 other
8 distress
5 becky
7 resumed
3 her
7 picture
11 inspections
4 with
6 alfred
3 but
2 as
3 the
7 minutes
7 dragged
5 along
3 and
2 no
3 tom
4 came
2 to
6 suffer
3 her
7 triumph
5 began
2 to
5 cloud
3 and
3 she
4 lost
8 interest
7 gravity
3 and
6 absent
10 mindedness
8 followed
3 and
4 then
10 melancholy
3 two
2 or
5 three
5 times
3 she
7 pricked
2 up
3 her
3 ear
2 at
1 a
8 footstep
3 but
2 it
3 was
1 a
5 false
4 hope
2 no
3 tom
4 came
2 at
4 last
3 she
4 grew
8 entirely
9 miserable
3 and
6 wished
3 she
4 hadn
1 t
7 carried
2 it
2 so
3 far
4 when
4 poor
6 alfred
6 seeing
4 that
2 he
3 was
6 losing
3 her
2 he
3 did
3 not
4 know
3 how
4 kept
10 exclaiming
2 oh
4 here
1 s
1 a
5 jolly
3 one
4 look
2 at
4 this
3 she
4 lost
8 patience
2 at
4 last
3 and
4 said
2 oh
3 don
1 t
6 bother
2 me
1 i
3 don
1 t
4 care
3 for
4 them
3 and
5 burst
4 into
5 tears
3 and
3 got
2 up
3 and
6 walked
4 away
6 alfred
7 dropped
9 alongside
3 and
3 was
5 going
2 to
3 try
2 to
7 comfort
3 her
3 but
3 she
4 said
2 go
4 away
3 and
5 leave
2 me
5 alone
3 can
1 t
3 you
1 i
4 hate
3 you
2 so
3 the
3 boy
6 halted
9 wondering
4 what
2 he
5 could
4 have
4 done
3 for
3 she
3 had
4 said
3 she
5 would
4 look
2 at
8 pictures
3 all
7 through
3 the
7 nooning
3 and
3 she
6 walked
2 on
6 crying
4 then
6 alfred
4 went
6 musing
4 into
3 the
8 deserted
11 schoolhouse
2 he
3 was
10 humiliated
3 and
5 angry
2 he
6 easily
7 guessed
3 his
3 way
2 to
3 the
5 truth
3 the
4 girl
3 had
6 simply
4 made
1 a
11 convenience
2 of
3 him
2 to
4 vent
3 her
5 spite
4 upon
3 tom
6 sawyer
2 he
3 was
3 far
4 from
6 hating
3 tom
3 the
4 less
4 when
4 this
7 thought
8 occurred
2 to
3 him
2 he
6 wished
5 there
3 was
4 some
3 way
2 to
3 get
4 that
3 boy
4 into
7 trouble
7 without
4 much
4 risk
2 to
7 himself
3 tom
1 s
8 spelling
4 book
4 fell
5 under
3 his
3 eye
4 here
3 was
3 his
11 opportunity
2 he
10 gratefully
6 opened
2 to
3 the
6 lesson
3 for
3 the
9 afternoon
3 and
6 poured
3 ink
4 upon
3 the
4 page
5 becky
8 glancing
2 in
2 at
1 a
6 window
6 behind
3 him
2 at
3 the
6 moment
3 saw
3 the
3 act
3 and
5 moved
2 on
7 without
11 discovering
7 herself
3 she
7 started
8 homeward
3 now
9 intending
2 to
4 find
3 tom
3 and
4 tell
3 him
3 tom
5 would
2 be
8 thankful
3 and
5 their
8 troubles
5 would
2 be
6 healed
6 before
3 she
3 was
4 half
3 way
4 home
7 however
3 she
3 had
7 changed
3 her
4 mind
3 the
7 thought
2 of
3 tom
1 s
9 treatment
2 of
3 her
4 when
3 she
3 was
7 talking
5 about
3 her
6 picnic
4 came
9 scorching
4 back
3 and
6 filled
3 her
4 with
5 shame
3 she
8 resolved
2 to
3 let
3 him
3 get
7 whipped
2 on
3 the
7 damaged
8 spelling
4 book
1 s
7 account
3 and
2 to
4 hate
3 him
7 forever
4 into
3 the
7 bargain
7 chapter
3 xix
3 tom
7 arrived
2 at
4 home
2 in
1 a
6 dreary
4 mood
3 and
3 the
5 first
5 thing
3 his
4 aunt
4 said
2 to
3 him
6 showed
3 him
4 that
2 he
3 had
7 brought
3 his
7 sorrows
2 to
2 an
11 unpromising
6 market
3 tom

12 schoolmaster
5 every

2 he
4 took
1 a
10 mysterious
4 book
3 out
2 of

9 presently
3 the

7 trouble
2 by
7 denying
4 that
2 he
5 spilt
3 the

2 on

3 and
3 she
3 was
5 right
3 the

5 worse
3 for

3 and
3 she
5 tried

3 but
3 she
5 found
3 she
3 was
3 not

4 when
3 the
5 worst
4 came
2 to
3 the

3 she
3 had
2 an

3 and
4 went
4 back
2 to
3 his
4 seat
3 not
2 at
3 all
6 broken
7 hearted
3 for
2 he
7 thought
2 it
3 was
8 possible
4 that
2 he
3 had
11 unknowingly
5 upset
3 the
3 ink
2 on
3 the
8 spelling
4 book
7 himself
2 in

10 skylarking
4 bout
2 he
3 had
6 denied

3 for

3 and
7 because

4 then
8 unlocked
3 his

3 and
7 reached
3 for
3 his
4 book
3 but
6 seemed
9 undecided
7 whether
2 to
4 take
2 it
3 out
2 or
5 leave
2 it
4 most
2 of
3 the
6 pupils
7 glanced
2 up
9 languidly
3 but
5 there
4 were
3 two
5 among

4 that
7 watched
3 his

4 with
6 intent
4 eyes
2 mr
7 dobbins
8 fingered
3 his
4 book
8 absently
3 for
1 a
5 while

4 took
2 it
3 out
3 and
7 settled
7 himself
2 in

5 could
11 contemplate
4 with

3 the
7 glaring
11 insincerity
2 of
5 these
7 sermons
3 was
3 not
10 sufficient
2 to
7 compass
3 the
10 banishment
2 of
3 the
7 fashion
4 from

3 and
2 it
2 is
3 not
10 sufficient
2 to
3 day
2 it
5 never
4 will

4 with
1 a

3 and
3 you
4 will
4 find
4 that
3 the

2 of
3 the
4 most
9 frivolous
3 and
3 the

9 religious
4 girl
2 in

6 enough
2 of

4 hour
7 arrives
3 for
3 her

4 into
3 the
7 elysian
5 world
2 of
5 which
3 she
3 has
3 had
4 such

4 each

5 finds
4 that
7 beneath

3 all
2 is
6 vanity
3 the

3 was
1 a

4 from

6 during
3 the

11 accompanied
2 by

1 a

6 speech
2 in

3 the
4 most
8 eloquent
5 thing
2 he
3 had
4 ever
8 listened

2 he
4 made
1 a

3 his
8 unsteady
4 hand
3 and
1 a
9 smothered
6 titter
7 rippled

2 he
4 only
9 distorted

4 more
4 than

2 of
6 cadets
2 of
10 temperance
5 being
9 attracted
2 by
3 the
5 showy
9 character
2 of
5 their

2 he
8 promised
2 to

7 chewing
3 and
9 profanity
2 as
4 long
2 as
2 he
8 remained
1 a
6 member
3 now
2 he
5 found
3 out
1 a
3 new
5 thing
6 namely
4 that
2 to
7 promise
3 not
2 to
2 do
1 a
5 thing
2 is
3 the
6 surest
3 way
2 in
3 the
5 world
2 to
4 make
1 a
4 body
4 want
2 to
2 go
3 and
2 do
4 that
4 very
5 thing
3 tom
4 soon
5 found
7 himself
9 tormented
4 with
1 a
6 desire
2 to
5 drink
3 and
5 swear
3 the
6 desire
4 grew
2 to
2 be
2 so
7 intense
4 that
7 nothing
3 but
3 the
4 hope
2 of
1 a
6 chance
2 to
7 display
7 himself
2 in
3 his
3 red
4 sash
4 kept
3 him
4 from
11 withdrawing
4 from
3 the
5 order
6 fourth
2 of
4 july
3 was
6 coming
3 but
2 he
4 soon
4 gave
4 that
2 up
4 gave
2 it
2 up
6 before
2 he
3 had
4 worn
3 his
8 shackles
4 over
5 forty
5 eight
5 hours
3 and
5 fixed
3 his
5 hopes
4 upon
3 old
5 judge
6 frazer
7 justice
2 of
3 the
5 peace
3 who
3 was
10 apparently
2 on
3 his
8 deathbed
3 and
5 would
4 have
1 a
3 big
6 public
7 funeral
5 since
2 he
3 was
2 so
4 high
2 an
8 official
6 during
5 three
4 days
3 tom
3 was
6 deeply
9 concerned
5 about
3 the
5 judge
1 s
9 condition
3 and
6 hungry
3 for
4 news
2 of
2 it
9 sometimes
3 his
5 hopes
3 ran
4 high
2 so
4 high
4 that
2 he
5 would
7 venture
2 to
3 get
3 out
3 his
7 regalia
3 and
8 practise
6 before
3 the
7 looking
5 glass
3 but
3 the
5 judge
3 had
1 a
4 most
12 discouraging
3 way
2 of
11 fluctuating
2 at
4 last
2 he
3 was
10 pronounced
4 upon
3 the
4 mend
3 and
4 then
12 convalescent
3 tom
3 was
9 disgusted
3 and
4 felt
1 a
5 sense
2 of
6 injury
3 too
2 he
6 handed
2 in
3 his
11 resignation
2 at
4 once
3 and
4 that
5 night
3 the
5 judge
8 suffered
1 a
7 relapse
3 and
4 died
3 tom
8 resolved
4 that
2 he
5 would
5 never
5 trust
1 a
3 man
4 like
4 that
5 again
3 the
7 funeral
3 was
1 a
4 fine
5 thing
3 the
6 cadets
7 paraded
2 in
1 a
5 style

3 tom
3 was
1 a
4 free
3 boy
5 again
7 however
5 there
3 was
9 something
2 in
4 that
2 he
5 could
5 drink
3 and
5 swear
3 now
3 but
5 found
2 to
3 his
8 surprise
4 that
2 he
3 did
3 not
4 want
2 to
3 the
6 simple
4 fact
4 that
2 he
5 could
4 took
3 the
6 desire
4 away
3 and
3 the
5 charm
2 of
2 it
3 tom
9 presently
8 wondered
2 to
4 find
4 that
3 his
7 coveted
8 vacation
3 was
9 beginning
2 to
4 hang
1 a
6 little
7 heavily
2 on
3 his
5 hands
2 he
9 attempted
1 a
5 diary
3 but
7 nothing
8 happened
6 during
5 three
4 days
3 and

4 even
3 the

4 some
4 boys
3 and
5 girls
7 parties
3 but
4 they
4 were
2 so
3 few
3 and
2 so
10 delightful
4 that
4 they
4 only
4 made
3 the
6 aching
5 voids
7 between
4 ache

2 to
3 her
14 constantinople
4 home
2 to
4 stay
4 with
3 her
7 parents
6 during
8 vacation
2 so
5 there
3 was
2 no
6 bright
4 side
2 to
4 life
8 anywhere
3 the
8 dreadful
6 secret
2 of
3 the
6 murder
3 was
1 a
7 chronic
6 misery
2 it
3 was
1 a
4 very
6 cancer
3 for
10 permanency
3 and
4 pain
4 then
4 came
3 the
7 measles
6 during
3 two
4 long
5 weeks
3 tom
3 lay
1 a
8 prisoner
4 dead
2 to
3 the
5 world
3 and
3 its
10 happenings
2 he
3 was
4 very
3 ill
2 he
3 was
10 interested
2 in
7 nothing
4 when
2 he
3 got
4 upon
3 his
4 feet
2 at
4 last
3 and
5 moved
6 feebly
4 down
4 town
1 a
10 melancholy
6 change
3 had
4 come
4 over
10 everything
3 and
5 every
8 creature
5 there
3 had
4 been
1 a
7 revival
3 and
9 everybody
3 had
3 got
8 religion
3 not
4 only
3 the
6 adults
3 but
4 even
3 the
4 boys
3 and
5 girls
3 tom
4 went
5 about
6 hoping
7 against
4 hope
3 for
3 the
5 sight
2 of
3 one
7 blessed
6 sinful
4 face
3 but
14 disappointment
7 crossed
3 him
10 everywhere
2 he
5 found
3 joe
6 harper
8 studying
1 a
9 testament
3 and
6 turned
5 sadly
4 away
4 from
3 the
10 depressing
9 spectacle
2 he
6 sought
3 ben
6 rogers
3 and
5 found
3 him
8 visiting
3 the
4 poor
4 with
1 a
6 basket
2 of
6 tracts
2 he
6 hunted
2 up
3 jim
6 hollis
3 who
6 called
3 his
9 attention
2 to
3 the
8 precious
8 blessing
2 of
3 his
4 late
7 measles
2 as
1 a
7 warning
5 every
3 boy
2 he
11 encountered
5 added
7 another
3 ton
2 to
3 his
10 depression
3 and
4 when
2 in
11 desperation
2 he
4 flew
3 for
6 refuge
2 at
4 last
2 to
3 the
5 bosom
2 of
11 huckleberry
4 finn
3 and
3 was
8 received
4 with
1 a
10 scriptural
9 quotation
3 his
5 heart
5 broke
3 and
2 he
5 crept
4 home
3 and
2 to
3 bed
9 realizing
4 that
2 he
5 alone
2 of
3 all
3 the
4 town
3 was
4 lost
7 forever
3 and
7 forever
3 and
4 that
5 night
5 there
4 came
2 on
1 a
8 terrific
5 storm
4 with
7 driving
4 rain
5 awful
5 claps
2 of
7 thunder
3 and
8 blinding
6 sheets
2 of
9 lightning
2 he
7 covered
3 his
4 head
4 with
3 the
10 bedclothes
3 and
6 waited
2 in
1 a
6 horror
2 of
8 suspense
3 for
3 his
4 doom
3 for
2 he
3 had
3 not
3 the
6 shadow
2 of
1 a
5 doubt
4 that
3 all
4 this
6 hubbub
3 was
5 about
3 him
2 he
8 believed
2 he
3 had
5 taxed
3 the
11 forbearance
2 of
3 the
6 powers
5 above
2 to
3 the
9 extremity
2 of
9 endurance
3 and
4 that
4 this
3 was
3 the
6 result
2 it
5 might
4 have
6 seemed
2 to
3 him
1 a
5 waste
2 of
4 pomp
3 and
10 ammunition
2 to
4 kill
1 a
3 bug
4 with
1 a
7 battery
2 of
9 artillery
3 but
5 there
6 seemed
7 nothing
11 incongruous
5 about
3 the
7 getting
2 up
4 such
2 an
9 expensive
12 thunderstorm
2 as
4 this
2 to
5 knock
3 the
4 turf
4 from
5 under
2 an
6 insect
4 like
7 himself
2 by
3 and
2 by
3 the
7 tempest
5 spent
6 itself
3 and
4 died
7 without
13 accomplishing
3 its
6 object
3 the
3 boy
1 s
5 first
7 impulse
3 was
2 to
2 be
8 grateful
3 and
6 reform
3 his
6 second
3 was
2 to
4 wait
3 for
5 there
5 might
3 not
2 be
3 any
4 more
6 storms
3 the
4 next
3 day
3 the
7 doctors
4 were
4 back
3 tom
3 had
8 relapsed
3 the
5 three
5 weeks
2 he
5 spent
2 on
3 his
4 back
4 this
4 time
6 seemed
2 an
6 entire
3 age
4 when
2 he
3 got
6 abroad
2 at
4 last
2 he
3 was
6 hardly
8 grateful
4 that
2 he
3 had
4 been
6 spared
11 remembering
3 how
6 lonely
3 was
3 his
6 estate
3 how
13 companionless
3 and
7 forlorn
2 he
3 was
2 he
7 drifted
10 listlessly
4 down
3 the
6 street
3 and
5 found
3 jim
6 hollis
6 acting
2 as
5 judge
2 in
1 a
8 juvenile
5 court
4 that
3 was
6 trying
1 a
3 cat
3 for
6 murder
2 in
3 the
8 presence
2 of
3 her
6 victim
1 a
4 bird
2 he
5 found
3 joe
6 harper
3 and
4 huck
4 finn
2 up
2 an
5 alley
6 eating
1 a
6 stolen
5 melon
4 poor
4 lads
4 they
4 like
3 tom
3 had
8 suffered
1 a
7 relapse
7 chapter
5 xxiii
2 at
4 last
3 the
6 sleepy
10 atmosphere
3 was
7 stirred
3 and
10 vigorously
3 the
6 murder
5 trial
4 came
2 on
2 in
3 the
5 court
2 it
6 became
3 the
9 absorbing
5 topic
2 of
7 village
4 talk
11 immediately
3 tom
5 could
3 not
3 get
4 away
4 from
2 it
5 every
9 reference
2 to
3 the
6 murder
4 sent
1 a
7 shudder
2 to
3 his
5 heart
3 for
3 his
8 troubled
10 conscience
3 and
5 fears
6 almost
9 persuaded
3 him
4 that
5 these
7 remarks
4 were
3 put
5 forth
2 in
3 his
7 hearing
2 as
7 feelers
2 he
3 did
3 not
3 see
3 how
2 he
5 could
2 be
9 suspected
2 of
7 knowing
8 anything
5 about
3 the
6 murder
3 but
5 still
2 he
5 could
3 not
2 be
11 comfortable
2 in
3 the
5 midst
2 of
4 this
6 gossip
2 it
4 kept
3 him
2 in
1 a
4 cold
6 shiver
3 all
3 the
4 time
2 he
4 took
4 huck
2 to
1 a
6 lonely
5 place
2 to
4 have
1 a
4 talk
4 with
3 him
2 it
5 would
2 be
4 some
6 relief
2 to
6 unseal
3 his
6 tongue
3 for
1 a
6 little
5 while
2 to
6 divide
3 his
6 burden
2 of
8 distress
4 with
7 another
8 sufferer
8 moreover
2 he
6 wanted
2 to

7 hanging
5 about
3 the
12 neighborhood

9 undefined
4 hope

9 gratitude
3 for
5 their
5 gifts

3 cut
6 deeper
4 than
4 ever
4 this
4 time
4 they
4 felt
8 cowardly
3 and

3 and
3 the
3 day
5 after

5 drawn
2 by
2 an
6 almost
12 irresistible
7 impulse
2 to

2 of
3 the
6 second
3 day
3 the

6 effect
4 that
5 injun
3 joe
1 s
8 evidence
5 stood
4 firm
3 and
8 unshaken
3 and
4 that
5 there
3 was
3 not
3 the

8 question
2 as
2 to
4 what
3 the
4 jury
1 s

4 then
7 casting
1 a
8 yearning
3 eye
4 down
4 upon
3 the
7 haunted
5 house
3 and
7 passing
1 a
6 remark
5 about
3 the
6 morrow
1 s
9 prospects
3 and
13 possibilities
5 there
2 as
3 the
3 sun
5 began
2 to
4 sink
4 into
3 the
4 west
4 they
4 took
5 their
3 way
8 homeward
7 athwart
3 the
4 long
7 shadows
2 of
3 the
5 trees
3 and
4 soon
4 were
6 buried
4 from
5 sight
2 in
3 the
7 forests
2 of
7 cardiff
4 hill
2 on
8 saturday
7 shortly
5 after
4 noon
3 the
4 boys
4 were
2 at
3 the
4 dead
4 tree
5 again
4 they
3 had
1 a
5 smoke
3 and
1 a
4 chat
2 in
3 the
5 shade
3 and
4 then
3 dug
1 a
6 little
2 in
5 their
4 last
4 hole
3 not
4 with
5 great
4 hope
3 but
6 merely
7 because
3 tom
4 said
5 there
4 were
2 so
4 many
5 cases
5 where
6 people
3 had
5 given
2 up
1 a
8 treasure
5 after
7 getting
4 down
6 within
3 six
6 inches
2 of
2 it
3 and
4 then
8 somebody
4 else
3 had
4 come
5 along
3 and
6 turned
2 it
2 up
4 with
1 a
6 single
6 thrust
2 of
1 a
6 shovel
3 the
5 thing
6 failed
4 this
4 time
7 however
2 so
3 the
4 boys
10 shouldered
5 their
5 tools
3 and
4 went
4 away
7 feeling
4 that
4 they
3 had
3 not
7 trifled
4 with
7 fortune
3 but
3 had
9 fulfilled
3 all
3 the
12 requirements
4 that
6 belong
2 to
3 the
8 business
2 of
8 treasure
7 hunting
4 when
4 they
7 reached
3 the
7 haunted
5 house
5 there
3 was
9 something
2 so
5 weird
3 and
6 grisly
5 about
3 the
4 dead
7 silence
4 that
7 reigned
5 there
5 under
3 the
6 baking
3 sun
3 and
9 something
2 so
10 depressing
5 about
3 the
10 loneliness
3 and
10 desolation
2 of
3 the
5 place
4 that
4 they
4 were
6 afraid
3 for
1 a
6 moment
2 to
7 venture
2 in
4 then
4 they
5 crept
2 to
3 the
4 door
3 and
4 took
1 a
9 trembling
4 peep
4 they
3 saw
1 a
4 weed
5 grown
9 floorless
4 room
11 unplastered
2 an
7 ancient
9 fireplace
6 vacant
7 windows
1 a
7 ruinous
9 staircase
3 and
4 here
5 there
3 and
10 everywhere
4 hung
6 ragged
3 and
9 abandoned
7 cobwebs
4 they
9 presently
7 entered
6 softly
4 with
9 quickened
6 pulses
7 talking
2 in
8 whispers
4 ears
5 alert
2 to
5 catch
3 the
9 slightest
5 sound
3 and
7 muscles
5 tense
3 and
5 ready
3 for
7 instant
7 retreat
2 in
1 a
6 little
5 while
11 familiarity
8 modified
5 their
5 fears
3 and
4 they
4 gave
3 the
5 place
1 a
8 critical
3 and
10 interested
11 examination
6 rather
8 admiring
5 their
3 own
8 boldness
3 and
9 wondering
2 at
2 it
3 too
4 next
4 they
6 wanted
2 to
4 look
2 up
6 stairs
4 this
3 was
9 something
4 like
7 cutting
3 off
7 retreat
3 but
4 they
3 got
2 to
6 daring
4 each
5 other
3 and
2 of
6 course
5 there
5 could
2 be
3 but
3 one
6 result
4 they
5 threw
5 their
5 tools
4 into
1 a
6 corner
3 and
4 made
3 the
6 ascent
2 up
5 there
4 were
3 the
4 same
5 signs
2 of
5 decay
2 in
3 one
6 corner
4 they
5 found
1 a
6 closet
4 that
8 promised
7 mystery
3 but
3 the
7 promise
3 was
1 a
5 fraud
5 there
3 was
7 nothing
2 in
2 it
5 their
7 courage
3 was
2 up
3 now
3 and
4 well
2 in
4 hand
4 they
4 were
5 about
2 to
2 go
4 down
3 and
5 begin
4 work
4 when

10 themselves
4 upon
3 the
5 floor
4 with
5 their
4 eyes
2 to
4 knot
5 holes
2 in
3 the
8 planking

3 the
7 speaker

6 moment
9 undecided
3 and
4 then
6 turned
6 toward
3 the
8 stairway
3 the

3 but
5 their
8 strength
3 was
4 gone
3 the
5 steps
4 came
8 creaking
2 up
3 the

3 the
11 intolerable
8 distress
2 of

10 resolution
2 of
3 the
4 lads
4 they
4 were
5 about
2 to
6 spring
3 for
3 the

4 when
5 there
3 was

2 of

7 timbers
3 and
5 injun
3 joe
6 landed
2 on
3 the

2 of
3 the
6 ruined
8 stairway
2 he
8 gathered
7 himself
2 up
7 cursing

7 minutes
3 and
4 then

1 m
7 willing
2 in

7 whoever

6 devils
2 or
9 something
1 i
2 ll
3 bet
4 they
2 re
7 running
3 yet
3 joe
8 grumbled
6 awhile
4 then
2 he
6 agreed
4 with
3 his
6 friend
4 that
4 what
8 daylight
3 was
4 left
5 ought
2 to
2 be
10 economized
2 in
7 getting
6 things
5 ready
3 for
7 leaving
7 shortly
9 afterward
4 they
7 slipped
3 out
2 of
3 the
5 house
2 in
3 the
9 deepening
8 twilight
3 and
5 moved
6 toward
3 the
5 river
4 with
5 their
8 precious
3 box
3 tom
3 and
4 huck
4 rose
2 up
4 weak
3 but
6 vastly
8 relieved
3 and
6 stared
5 after
4 them
7 through
3 the
6 chinks
7 between
3 the
4 logs
2 of
3 the
5 house
6 follow
3 not
4 they
4 they
4 were
7 content
2 to
5 reach
6 ground
5 again
7 without
6 broken
5 necks
3 and
4 take
3 the
8 townward
5 track
4 over
3 the
4 hill
4 they
3 did
3 not
4 talk
4 much
4 they
4 were
3 too
4 much
8 absorbed
2 in
6 hating
10 themselves
6 hating
3 the
3 ill
4 luck
4 that
4 made
4 them
4 take
3 the
5 spade
3 and
3 the
4 pick
5 there
3 but
3 for
4 that
5 injun
3 joe
5 never
5 would
4 have
9 suspected
2 he
5 would
4 have
6 hidden
3 the
6 silver
4 with
3 the
4 gold
2 to
4 wait
5 there
4 till
3 his
7 revenge
3 was
9 satisfied
3 and
4 then
2 he
5 would
4 have
3 had
3 the
10 misfortune
2 to
4 find
4 that
5 money
4 turn
2 up
7 missing
6 bitter
6 bitter
4 luck
4 that
3 the
5 tools
4 were
4 ever
7 brought
5 there
4 they
8 resolved
2 to
4 keep
1 a
7 lookout
3 for
4 that
8 spaniard
4 when
2 he
6 should
4 come
2 to
4 town
6 spying
3 out
3 for
7 chances
2 to
2 do
3 his
10 revengeful
3 job
3 and
6 follow
3 him
2 to
6 number
3 two
8 wherever
4 that
5 might
2 be
4 then
1 a
7 ghastly
7 thought
8 occurred
2 to
3 tom
7 revenge
4 what
2 if
2 he
5 means
2 us
4 huck
2 oh
3 don
1 t
4 said
4 huck
6 nearly
8 fainting
4 they
6 talked
2 it
3 all
4 over
3 and
2 as
4 they
7 entered
4 town
4 they
6 agreed
2 to
7 believe
4 that
2 he
5 might
8 possibly
4 mean
8 somebody
4 else
2 at
5 least
4 that
2 he
5 might
2 at
5 least
4 mean
6 nobody
3 but
3 tom
5 since
4 only
3 tom
3 had
9 testified
4 very
4 very
5 small
7 comfort
2 it
3 was
2 to
3 tom
2 to
2 be
5 alone
2 in
6 danger
7 company
5 would
2 be
1 a
8 palpable
11 improvement
2 he
7 thought
7 chapter
5 xxvii
3 the
9 adventure
2 of
3 the
3 day
8 mightily
9 tormented
3 tom
1 s
6 dreams
4 that
5 night
4 four
5 times
2 he
3 had
3 his
5 hands
2 on
4 that
4 rich
8 treasure
3 and
4 four
5 times
2 it
6 wasted
2 to
11 nothingness
2 in
3 his
7 fingers
2 as
5 sleep
7 forsook
3 him
3 and
11 wakefulness
7 brought
4 back
3 the
4 hard
7 reality
2 of
3 his
10 misfortune
2 as
2 he
3 lay
2 in
3 the
5 early
7 morning
9 recalling
3 the
9 incidents
2 of
3 his
5 great
9 adventure
2 he
7 noticed
4 that
4 they
6 seemed
9 curiously
7 subdued
3 and
3 far
4 away
8 somewhat
2 as
2 if
4 they
3 had
8 happened
2 in
7 another
5 world
2 or
2 in
1 a
4 time
4 long
4 gone
2 by
4 then
2 it
8 occurred
2 to
3 him
4 that
3 the
5 great
9 adventure
6 itself
4 must
2 be
1 a
5 dream
5 there
3 was
3 one
4 very
6 strong
8 argument
2 in
5 favor
2 of
4 this
4 idea
6 namely
4 that
3 the
8 quantity
2 of
4 coin
2 he
3 had
4 seen
3 was
3 too
4 vast
2 to
2 be
4 real
2 he
3 had
5 never
4 seen
2 as
4 much
2 as
5 fifty
7 dollars
2 in
3 one
4 mass
6 before
3 and
2 he
3 was
4 like
3 all
4 boys
2 of
3 his
3 age
3 and
7 station
2 in
4 life
2 in
4 that
2 he
8 imagined
4 that
3 all
10 references
2 to
8 hundreds
3 and
9 thousands
4 were
4 mere
8 fanciful
5 forms
2 of
6 speech
3 and
4 that
2 no
4 such
4 sums
6 really
7 existed
2 in
3 the
5 world
2 he
5 never
3 had
8 supposed
3 for
1 a
6 moment
4 that
2 so
5 large
1 a
3 sum
2 as
1 a
7 hundred
7 dollars
3 was
2 to
2 be
5 found
2 in
6 actual
5 money
2 in
3 any
3 one
1 s
10 possession
2 if
3 his
7 notions
2 of
6 hidden
8 treasure
3 had
4 been
8 analyzed
4 they
5 would
4 have
4 been
5 found
2 to
7 consist
2 of
1 a
7 handful
2 of
4 real
5 dimes
3 and
1 a
6 bushel
2 of
5 vague
8 splendid
11 ungraspable
7 dollars
3 but
3 the
9 incidents
2 of
3 his
9 adventure
4 grew
8 sensibly
7 sharper
3 and
7 clearer
5 under
3 the
9 attrition
2 of
8 thinking
4 them
4 over
3 and
2 so
2 he
9 presently
5 found
7 himself
7 leaning
2 to
3 the
10 impression
4 that
3 the
5 thing
5 might
3 not
4 have
4 been
1 a
5 dream
5 after
3 all
4 this
11 uncertainty
4 must
2 be
5 swept
4 away
2 he
5 would
6 snatch
1 a
7 hurried
9 breakfast
3 and
2 go
3 and
4 find
4 huck
4 huck
3 was
7 sitting

4 feet
2 in
3 the
5 water
3 and
7 looking
4 very
10 melancholy
3 tom
9 concluded
2 to
3 let
4 huck
4 lead
2 up
2 to
3 the
7 subject
2 if
2 he
3 did
3 not
2 do
2 it
4 then
3 the
9 adventure
5 would
2 be
6 proved
2 to
4 have
4 been
4 only
1 a
5 dream

4 huck
5 stood
6 sentry
3 and
3 tom
4 felt
3 his
3 way
4 into
3 the
5 alley
4 then
5 there
3 was
1 a
6 season
2 of
7 waiting
7 anxiety
4 that
7 weighed
4 upon
4 huck
1 s
7 spirits
4 like
1 a
8 mountain
2 he
5 began
2 to
4 wish
2 he
5 could

5 flash
4 from

7 lantern
2 it
5 would
8 frighten

6 seemed
5 hours
5 since

3 had
11 disappeared
6 surely
2 he
4 must
4 have
7 fainted
5 maybe
2 he
3 was

5 heart
3 had
5 burst
5 under
6 terror
3 and
10 excitement
2 in
3 his
10 uneasiness
4 huck
5 found
7 himself
7 drawing
6 closer
3 and
6 closer
2 to
3 the
5 alley
7 fearing
3 all
5 sorts
2 of
8 dreadful
6 things
3 and
11 momentarily
9 expecting
4 some
11 catastrophe
2 to
6 happen
4 that
5 would
4 take
4 away
3 his
6 breath
5 there
3 was
3 not
4 much
2 to
4 take
4 away
3 for
2 he
6 seemed
4 only
4 able
2 to
6 inhale
2 it
2 by
11 thimblefuls
3 and
3 his
5 heart
5 would
4 soon
4 wear
6 itself
3 out
3 the
3 way
2 it
3 was
7 beating
8 suddenly
5 there

1 a
7 thought
2 of

3 she
5 would
3 the
5 widow
7 douglas
8 splendid
11 hospitality
3 was
1 a
8 tempting
4 bait
2 it
3 and
3 tom
1 s
11 persuasions
9 presently
7 carried
3 the
3 day
2 so
2 it
3 was
7 decided
2 to
3 say
7 nothing
7 anybody
5 about
3 the
5 night
1 s
9 programme
9 presently
2 it
8 occurred
2 to
3 tom
4 that
5 maybe
4 huck
5 might
4 come
4 this
4 very
5 night
3 and
4 give
3 the
6 signal
3 the
7 thought
4 took
1 a
4 deal
2 of
3 the
6 spirit
3 out
2 of
3 his
13 anticipations
5 still
2 he
5 could
3 not
4 bear
2 to
4 give
2 up
3 the
3 fun
2 at
5 widow
7 douglas
3 and
3 why
6 should
2 he
4 give
2 it
2 up
2 he
8 reasoned
3 the
6 signal
3 did
3 not
4 come
3 the
5 night
6 before
2 so
3 why
6 should
2 it
2 be
3 any
4 more
6 likely
2 to
4 come
2 to
5 night
3 the
4 sure
3 fun
2 of
3 the
7 evening
10 outweighed
3 the
9 uncertain
8 treasure
3 and
3 boy
4 like
2 he
10 determined
2 to
5 yield
2 to
3 the
8 stronger
11 inclination
3 and
3 not
5 allow
7 himself
2 to
5 think
2 of
3 the
3 box
2 of
5 money
7 another
4 time
4 that
3 day
5 three
5 miles
5 below
4 town
3 the
9 ferryboat
7 stopped
2 at
3 the
5 mouth
2 of
1 a
5 woody
6 hollow
3 and
4 tied
2 up
3 the
5 crowd
7 swarmed
6 ashore
3 and
4 soon
3 the
6 forest
9 distances
3 and
6 craggy
7 heights
6 echoed
3 far
3 and
4 near
4 with
9 shoutings
3 and
8 laughter
3 all
3 the
9 different
4 ways
2 of
7 getting
3 hot
3 and
5 tired
4 were
4 gone
7 through
4 with
3 and
2 by
3 and
2 by
3 the
6 rovers
9 straggled
4 back
2 to
4 camp
9 fortified
4 with
11 responsible
9 appetites
3 and
4 then
3 the
11 destruction
2 of
3 the
4 good
6 things
5 began
5 after
3 the
5 feast
5 there
3 was
1 a
10 refreshing
6 season
2 of
4 rest
3 and
4 chat
2 in
3 the
5 shade
2 of
9 spreading
4 oaks
2 by
3 and
2 by
8 somebody
7 shouted
3 who
1 s
5 ready
3 for
3 the
4 cave
9 everybody
3 was
7 bundles
2 of
7 candles
4 were
8 procured
3 and
11 straightway
5 there
3 was
1 a
7 general
7 scamper
2 up
3 the
4 hill
3 the
5 mouth
2 of
3 the
4 cave
3 was
2 up
3 the
8 hillside
2 an
7 opening
6 shaped
4 like
1 a
6 letter
1 a
3 its
7 massive
5 oaken
4 door
5 stood
8 unbarred
6 within
3 was
1 a
5 small
7 chamber
6 chilly
2 as
2 an
3 ice
5 house
3 and
6 walled
2 by
6 nature
4 with
5 solid
9 limestone
4 that
3 was
4 dewy
4 with
1 a
4 cold
5 sweat
2 it
3 was
8 romantic
3 and
10 mysterious
2 to
5 stand
4 here
2 in
3 the
4 deep
5 gloom
3 and
4 look
3 out
4 upon
3 the
5 green
6 valley
7 shining
2 in
3 the
3 sun
3 but
3 the
14 impressiveness
2 of
3 the
9 situation
7 quickly
4 wore
3 off
3 and
3 the
7 romping
5 began
5 again
3 the
6 moment
1 a
6 candle
3 was
7 lighted
5 there
3 was
1 a
7 general
4 rush
4 upon
3 the
5 owner
2 of
2 it
1 a
8 struggle
3 and
1 a
7 gallant
7 defence
8 followed
3 but
3 the
6 candle
3 was
4 soon
7 knocked
4 down
2 or
5 blown
3 out
3 and
4 then
5 there
3 was
1 a
4 glad
6 clamor
2 of
8 laughter
3 and
1 a
3 new
5 chase
3 but
3 all
6 things
4 have
2 an
3 end
2 by
3 and
2 by
3 the
10 procession
4 went
6 filing
4 down
3 the
5 steep
7 descent
2 of
3 the
4 main
6 avenue
3 the
10 flickering
4 rank
2 of
6 lights
5 dimly
9 revealing
3 the
5 lofty
5 walls
2 of
4 rock
6 almost
2 to
5 their
5 point
2 of
8 junction
5 sixty
4 feet
8 overhead
4 this
4 main
6 avenue
3 was
3 not
4 more
4 than
5 eight
2 or
3 ten
4 feet
4 wide
5 every
3 few
5 steps
5 other
5 lofty
3 and
5 still
8 narrower
8 crevices
8 branched
4 from
2 it
2 on
6 either
4 hand
3 for
8 mcdougal
1 s
4 cave
3 was
3 but
1 a
4 vast
9 labyrinth
2 of
7 crooked
6 aisles
4 that
3 ran
4 into
4 each
5 other
3 and
3 out
5 again
3 and
3 led
7 nowhere
2 it
3 was
4 said
4 that
3 one
5 might
6 wander
4 days
3 and
6 nights
8 together
7 through
3 its
9 intricate
6 tangle
2 of
5 rifts
3 and
6 chasms
3 and
5 never
4 find
3 the
3 end
2 of
3 the
4 cave
3 and
4 that
2 he
5 might
2 go
4 down
3 and
4 down
3 and
5 still
4 down
4 into
3 the
5 earth
3 and
2 it
3 was
4 just
3 the
4 same
9 labyrinth
5 under
9 labyrinth
3 and
2 no
3 end
2 to
3 any
2 of
4 them
2 no
3 man
4 knew
3 the
4 cave
4 that
3 was
2 an
10 impossible
5 thing
4 most
2 of
3 the
5 young
3 men
4 knew
1 a
7 portion
2 of
2 it
3 and
2 it
3 was
3 not
9 customary
2 to
7 venture
4 much
6 beyond
4 this
5 known
7 portion
3 tom
6 sawyer
4 knew
2 as
4 much
2 of
3 the
4 cave
2 as
3 any
3 one
3 the
10 procession
5 moved
5 along
3 the
4 main
6 avenue
4 some
5 three
8 quarters
2 of
1 a
4 mile
3 and
4 then
6 groups
3 and
7 couples
5 began
2 to
4 slip
5 aside
4 into
6 branch
7 avenues
3 fly
5 along
3 the
6 dismal
9 corridors
3 and
4 take
4 each
5 other
2 by
8 surprise
2 at
6 points
5 where
3 the
9 corridors
6 joined
5 again
7 parties
4 were
4 able
2 to
5 elude
4 each
5 other
3 for
3 the
5 space
2 of
4 half
2 an
4 hour
7 without
5 going
6 beyond
3 the
5 known
6 ground
2 by
3 and
2 by
3 one
5 group
5 after
7 another
4 came
10 straggling
4 back
2 to
3 the
5 mouth
2 of
3 the
4 cave
7 panting
9 hilarious
7 smeared
4 from

4 then
4 they
4 were
10 astonished
2 to
4 find
4 that
4 they
3 had
4 been
6 taking
2 no
4 note
2 of
4 time
3 and
4 that
5 night
3 was
5 about
2 at
4 hand
3 the
8 clanging
4 bell
3 had
4 been
7 calling
3 for
4 half
2 an
4 hour
7 however
4 this
4 sort
2 of
5 close
2 to
3 the
3 day
1 s
10 adventures
3 was
8 romantic
3 and
9 therefore
12 satisfactory
4 when
3 the
9 ferryboat
4 with
3 her
4 wild
7 freight
6 pushed
4 into
3 the
6 stream
6 nobody
5 cared
8 sixpence
3 for
3 the
6 wasted
4 time
3 but
3 the
7 captain
2 of
3 the
5 craft
4 huck
3 was
7 already
4 upon
3 his
5 watch
4 when
3 the
9 ferryboat
1 s
6 lights
4 went
8 glinting
4 past
3 the
5 wharf
2 he
5 heard
2 no
5 noise
2 on
5 board
3 for
3 the
5 young
6 people
4 were
2 as
7 subdued
3 and
5 still
2 as
6 people
7 usually
3 are
3 who
3 are
6 nearly
5 tired
2 to
5 death
2 he
8 wondered
4 what
4 boat
2 it
3 was
3 and
3 why
3 she
3 did
3 not
4 stop
2 at
3 the
5 wharf
3 and
4 then
2 he
7 dropped
3 her
3 out
2 of
3 his
4 mind
3 and
3 put
3 his
9 attention
4 upon
3 his
8 business
3 the
5 night
3 was
7 growing
6 cloudy
3 and
4 dark
3 ten
1 o
5 clock
4 came
3 and
3 the
5 noise
2 of
8 vehicles
6 ceased
9 scattered
6 lights
5 began
2 to
4 wink
3 out
3 all
10 straggling
4 foot
10 passengers
11 disappeared
3 the
7 village
6 betook
6 itself
2 to
3 its
8 slumbers
3 and
4 left
3 the
5 small
7 watcher
5 alone
4 with
3 the
7 silence
3 and
3 the
6 ghosts
6 eleven
1 o
5 clock
4 came
3 and
3 the
6 tavern
6 lights
4 were
3 put
3 out
8 darkness
10 everywhere
3 now
4 huck
6 waited
4 what
6 seemed
1 a
5 weary
4 long
4 time
3 but
7 nothing
8 happened
3 his
5 faith
3 was
9 weakening
3 was
5 there
3 any
3 use
3 was
5 there
6 really
3 any
3 use
3 why
3 not
4 give
2 it
2 up
3 and
4 turn
2 in
1 a
5 noise
4 fell
4 upon
3 his
3 ear
2 he
3 was
3 all
9 attention
2 in
2 an
7 instant
3 the
5 alley
4 door
6 closed
6 softly
2 he
6 sprang
2 to
3 the
6 corner
2 of
3 the
5 brick
5 store
3 the
4 next
6 moment
3 two
3 men
7 brushed
2 by
3 him
3 and
3 one
6 seemed
2 to
4 have
9 something
5 under
3 his
3 arm
2 it
4 must
2 be
4 that
3 box
2 so
4 they
4 were
5 going
2 to
6 remove
3 the
8 treasure
3 why
4 call
3 tom
3 now
2 it
5 would
2 be
6 absurd
3 the
3 men
5 would
3 get
4 away
4 with
3 the
3 box
3 and
5 never
2 be
5 found
5 again
2 no
2 he
5 would
5 stick
2 to
5 their
4 wake
3 and
6 follow
4 them
2 he
5 would
5 trust
2 to
3 the
8 darkness
3 for
8 security
4 from
9 discovery
2 so
9 communing
4 with
7 himself
4 huck
7 stepped
3 out
3 and
6 glided
5 along
6 behind
3 the
3 men
3 cat
4 like
4 with
4 bare
4 feet
8 allowing
4 them
2 to
4 keep
4 just
3 far
6 enough
5 ahead
3 not
2 to
2 be
9 invisible
4 they
5 moved
2 up
3 the
5 river
6 street
5 three
6 blocks
4 then
6 turned
2 to
3 the
4 left
2 up
1 a
5 cross
6 street
4 they
4 went
8 straight
5 ahead
4 then
5 until
4 they
4 came
2 to
3 the
4 path
4 that
3 led
2 up
7 cardiff
4 hill
4 this
4 they
4 took
4 they
6 passed
2 by
3 the
3 old
8 welshman
1 s
5 house
4 half
3 way
2 up
3 the
4 hill
7 without
10 hesitating
3 and
5 still
7 climbed
6 upward
4 good
7 thought
4 huck
4 they
4 will
4 bury
2 it
2 in
3 the
3 old
6 quarry
3 but
4 they
5 never
7 stopped
2 at
3 the
6 quarry
4 they
6 passed
2 on
2 up
3 the
6 summit
4 they
7 plunged
4 into
3 the
6 narrow
4 path
7 between
3 the
4 tall
6 sumach
6 bushes
3 and
4 were
2 at
4 once
6 hidden
2 in
3 the
5 gloom
4 huck
6 closed
2 up
3 and
9 shortened
3 his
8 distance
3 now
3 for
4 they
5 would
5 never
2 be
4 able
2 to
3 see
3 him
2 he
7 trotted
5 along
6 awhile
4 then
9 slackened
3 his
4 pace
7 fearing
2 he
3 was
7 gaining
3 too
4 fast
5 moved
2 on
1 a
5 piece
4 then
7 stopped
10 altogether
8 listened
2 no
5 sound
4 none
4 save
4 that
2 he
6 seemed
2 to
4 hear
3 the
7 beating
2 of
3 his
3 own
5 heart
3 the
7 hooting
2 of
2 an
3 owl
4 came
4 over
3 the
4 hill
7 ominous
5 sound
3 but
2 no
9 footsteps
7 heavens
3 was
10 everything
4 lost
2 he
3 was
5 about
2 to
6 spring
4 with
6 winged
4 feet
4 when
1 a
3 man
7 cleared
3 his
6 throat
3 not
4 four
4 feet
4 from
3 him
4 huck
1 s
5 heart
4 shot
4 into
3 his
6 throat
3 but
2 he
9 swallowed
2 it
5 again
3 and
4 then
2 he
5 stood
5 there
7 shaking
2 as
2 if
1 a
5 dozen
5 agues
3 had
5 taken
6 charge
2 of
3 him
2 at
4 once
3 and
2 so
4 weak
4 that
2 he
7 thought
2 he
4 must
6 surely
4 fall
2 to
3 the
6 ground
2 he
4 knew
5 where
2 he
3 was
2 he
4 knew
2 he
3 was
6 within
4 five
5 steps
2 of
3 the
5 stile
7 leading
4 into
5 widow
7 douglas
7 grounds
4 very
4 well
2 he
7 thought
3 let
4 them
4 bury
2 it
5 there
2 it
3 won
1 t
2 be
4 hard
2 to
4 find
3 now

3 was
3 the
7 revenge
3 job
3 his
7 thought

4 than

3 the
3 old
3 man
4 from

4 hint
2 of
3 who
3 the
8 spaniard
5 might
2 be
3 and
3 yet
3 his

2 he
5 could
2 do
2 he
4 made

3 but
3 the
3 old
3 man
1 s

3 joe
3 the
8 welshman
6 almost
6 jumped
3 out

5 chair
2 in
1 a
6 moment
2 he
4 said
2 it
1 s
3 all
5 plain
6 enough
3 now
4 when
3 you
6 talked
5 about
8 notching
4 ears
3 and
8 slitting
5 noses
1 i
6 judged
4 that
4 that
3 was
4 your
3 own
13 embellishment
7 because
5 white
3 men
3 don
1 t
4 take
4 that
4 sort
2 of
7 revenge
3 but
2 an
5 injun
4 that
1 s
1 a
9 different
6 matter
10 altogether
6 during
9 breakfast
3 the
4 talk
4 went
2 on
3 and
2 in
3 the
6 course
2 of
2 it
3 the
3 old
3 man
4 said
4 that
3 the
4 last
5 thing
5 which
2 he
3 and
3 his
4 sons
3 had
4 done
6 before
5 going

3 was
2 to
3 get
1 a
7 lantern
3 and
7 examine
3 the
5 stile
3 and
3 its
8 vicinity
3 for
5 marks
2 of
5 blood
4 they
5 found
4 none
3 but
8 captured
1 a
5 bulky
6 bundle
2 of
2 of
4 what
2 if
3 the
5 words
3 had
4 been
9 lightning
4 they
5 could
3 not
4 have
6 leaped
4 with
1 a
4 more
8 stunning
10 suddenness
4 from
4 huck
1 s
8 blanched
4 lips
3 his
4 eyes
4 were
7 staring
4 wide
3 now
3 and
3 his
6 breath
9 suspended
7 waiting
3 for
3 the
6 answer
3 the
8 welshman
7 started
6 stared
2 in
6 return
5 three
7 seconds
4 five
7 seconds
3 ten
4 then
7 replied
2 of
7 burglar
1 s
5 tools
3 why
4 what
1 s
3 the
6 matter
4 with
3 you
4 huck
4 sank
4 back
7 panting
6 gently
3 but
6 deeply
11 unutterably
8 grateful
3 the
8 welshman
4 eyed
3 him
7 gravely
9 curiously
3 and
9 presently
4 said
3 yes
7 burglar
1 s
5 tools
4 that
7 appears
2 to
7 relieve
3 you
1 a
4 good
4 deal
3 but
4 what
3 did
4 give
3 you
4 that
4 turn
4 what
4 were
3 you
9 expecting
2 we
1 d
5 found
4 huck
3 was
2 in
1 a
5 close
5 place
3 the
9 inquiring
3 eye
3 was
4 upon
3 him
2 he
5 would
4 have
5 given
8 anything
3 for
8 material
3 for
1 a
9 plausible
6 answer
7 nothing
9 suggested
6 itself
3 the
9 inquiring
3 eye
3 was
6 boring
6 deeper
3 and
6 deeper
1 a
9 senseless
5 reply
7 offered
5 there
3 was
2 no
4 time
2 to
5 weigh
2 it
2 so
2 at
1 a
7 venture
2 he
7 uttered
2 it
6 feebly
6 sunday
6 school
5 books
5 maybe
4 poor
4 huck
3 was
3 too
10 distressed
2 to
5 smile
3 but
3 the
3 old
3 man
7 laughed
4 loud
3 and
8 joyously
5 shook
2 up
3 the
7 details
2 of
3 his
7 anatomy
4 from
4 head
2 to
4 foot
3 and
5 ended
2 by
6 saying
4 that
4 such
1 a
5 laugh
3 was
5 money
2 in
1 a
3 man
1 s
6 pocket
7 because
2 it
3 cut
4 down
3 the
6 doctor
1 s
4 bill
4 like
10 everything
4 then
2 he
5 added
4 poor
3 old
4 chap
3 you
2 re
5 white
3 and
5 jaded
3 you
3 ain
1 t
4 well
1 a
3 bit
2 no
6 wonder
3 you
2 re
1 a
6 little
7 flighty
3 and
3 off
4 your
7 balance
3 but
3 you
2 ll
4 come
3 out
2 of
2 it
4 rest
3 and
5 sleep
4 will
5 fetch
3 you
3 out
3 all
5 right
1 i
4 hope
4 huck
3 was
9 irritated
2 to
5 think
2 he
3 had
4 been
4 such
1 a
5 goose
3 and
8 betrayed
4 such
1 a
10 suspicious
10 excitement
3 for
2 he
3 had
7 dropped
3 the
4 idea
4 that
3 the
6 parcel
7 brought
4 from
3 the
6 tavern
3 was
3 the
8 treasure
2 as
4 soon
2 as
2 he
3 had
5 heard
3 the
4 talk
2 at
3 the
5 widow
1 s
5 stile
2 he
3 had
4 only
7 thought
2 it
3 was
3 not
3 the
8 treasure
7 however
2 he
3 had
3 not
5 known
4 that
2 it
4 wasn
1 t
3 and
2 so
3 the
10 suggestion
2 of
1 a
8 captured
6 bundle
3 was
3 too
4 much
3 for
3 his
4 self
10 possession
3 but
2 on
3 the

8 straggle
4 into
3 the

3 but
3 the
9 strongest
2 of
3 the
8 citizens
9 continued
9 searching
3 all
3 the
4 news
4 that
5 could
2 be
6 gained
3 was
4 that
12 remotenesses
2 of

6 lights

6 hither
3 and
7 thither
2 in
3 the

3 and
9 shoutings
3 and
6 pistol
5 shots
4 sent
5 their
6 hollow
14 reverberations
2 to
3 the
3 ear
4 down
3 the
6 sombre
6 aisles
2 in
3 one
5 place
3 far
4 from

10 recognized

2 it
3 was
3 the
4 last
5 relic
3 she
6 should

3 and
4 that
2 no
5 other
8 memorial
2 of
3 her
5 could
4 ever
2 be
2 so
8 precious
7 because
4 this
3 one

6 before
3 the

5 death
4 came

3 now
3 and
4 then
2 in
3 the
4 cave
1 a
3 far
4 away
5 speck
2 of
5 light
5 would
7 glimmer
3 and
4 then
1 a

5 shout
5 would
5 burst
5 forth
3 and
1 a
5 score
2 of
3 men
2 go
8 trooping
4 down
3 the
7 echoing
5 aisle
3 and
4 then
1 a
9 sickening
14 disappointment
6 always

7 dragged
5 their

3 the

4 sank
4 into
1 a
8 hopeless
6 stupor
2 no

3 had
5 heart
3 for

3 the

6 tavern
4 kept
6 liquor
2 on

8 scarcely

4 huck
6 feebly

10 discovered
2 at

2 on
9 presently
4 they
4 came
2 to
1 a
5 place
5 where
1 a
6 little
6 stream
2 of
5 water
9 trickling
4 over
1 a
5 ledge
3 and
8 carrying
1 a
9 limestone
8 sediment
4 with
2 it
3 had
2 in
3 the
4 slow
8 dragging
4 ages
6 formed
1 a
5 laced
3 and
7 ruffled
7 niagara
2 in
8 gleaming
3 and
12 imperishable
5 stone
3 tom
8 squeezed
3 his
5 small
4 body
6 behind
2 it
2 in
5 order
2 to
10 illuminate
2 it
3 for
5 becky
1 s
13 gratification
2 he
5 found
4 that
2 it
9 curtained
1 a
4 sort
2 of
5 steep
7 natural
8 stairway
5 which
3 was
8 enclosed
7 between
6 narrow
5 walls
3 and
2 at
4 once
3 the
8 ambition
2 to
2 be
1 a
10 discoverer
6 seized
3 him
5 becky
9 responded
2 to
3 his
4 call
3 and
4 they
4 made
1 a
5 smoke
4 mark
3 for
6 future
8 guidance
3 and
7 started
4 upon
5 their
5 quest
4 they
5 wound
4 this
3 way
3 and
4 that
3 far
4 down
4 into
3 the
6 secret
6 depths
2 of
3 the
4 cave
4 made
7 another
4 mark
3 and
8 branched
3 off
2 in
6 search
2 of
9 novelties
2 to
4 tell
3 the
5 upper
5 world
5 about
2 in
3 one
5 place
4 they
5 found
1 a
8 spacious
6 cavern
4 from
5 whose
7 ceiling
8 depended
1 a
9 multitude
2 of
7 shining
11 stalactites
2 of
3 the
6 length
3 and
13 circumference
2 of
1 a
3 man
1 s
3 leg
4 they
6 walked
3 all
5 about
2 it
9 wondering
3 and
8 admiring
3 and
9 presently
4 left
2 it
2 by
3 one
2 of
3 the
8 numerous
8 passages
4 that
6 opened
4 into
2 it
4 this
7 shortly
7 brought
4 them
2 to
1 a
10 bewitching
6 spring
5 whose
5 basin
3 was
9 incrusted
4 with
1 a
9 frostwork
2 of
10 glittering
8 crystals
2 it
3 was
2 in
3 the
5 midst
2 of
1 a
6 cavern
5 whose
5 walls
4 were
9 supported
2 by
4 many
9 fantastic
7 pillars
5 which
3 had
4 been
6 formed
2 by
3 the
7 joining
2 of
5 great
11 stalactites
3 and
11 stalagmites
8 together
3 the
6 result
2 of
3 the
9 ceaseless
5 water
4 drip
2 of
9 centuries
5 under
3 the
4 roof
4 vast
5 knots
2 of
4 bats
3 had
6 packed
10 themselves
8 together
9 thousands
2 in
1 a
5 bunch
3 the
6 lights
9 disturbed
3 the
9 creatures
3 and
4 they
4 came
8 flocking
4 down
2 by
8 hundreds
9 squeaking
3 and
7 darting
9 furiously
2 at
3 the
7 candles
3 tom
4 knew
5 their
4 ways
3 and
3 the
6 danger
2 of
4 this
4 sort
2 of
7 conduct
2 he
6 seized
5 becky
1 s
4 hand
3 and
7 hurried
3 her
4 into
3 the
5 first
8 corridor
4 that
7 offered
3 and
4 none
3 too
4 soon
3 for
1 a
3 bat
6 struck
5 becky
1 s
5 light
3 out
4 with
3 its
4 wing
5 while
3 she
3 was
7 passing
3 out
2 of
3 the
6 cavern
3 the
4 bats
6 chased
3 the
8 children
1 a
4 good
8 distance
3 but
3 the
9 fugitives
7 plunged
4 into
5 every
3 new
7 passage
4 that
7 offered
3 and
2 at
4 last
3 got
3 rid
2 of
3 the
8 perilous
6 things
3 tom
5 found
1 a
12 subterranean
4 lake
7 shortly
5 which
9 stretched
3 its
3 dim
6 length
4 away
5 until
3 its
5 shape
3 was
4 lost
2 in
3 the
7 shadows
2 he
6 wanted
2 to
7 explore
3 its
7 borders
3 but
9 concluded
4 that
2 it
5 would
2 be
4 best
2 to
3 sit
4 down
3 and
4 rest
6 awhile
5 first
3 now
3 for
3 the
5 first
4 time
3 the
4 deep
9 stillness
2 of
3 the
5 place
4 laid
1 a
6 clammy
4 hand
4 upon
3 the
7 spirits
2 of
3 the
8 children
5 becky
4 said
3 why
1 i
4 didn
1 t
6 notice
3 but
2 it
5 seems
4 ever
2 so
4 long
5 since
1 i
5 heard
3 any
2 of
3 the
6 others
4 come
2 to
5 think
5 becky
2 we
3 are
4 away
4 down
5 below
4 them
3 and
1 i
3 don
1 t
4 know
3 how
3 far
4 away
5 north
2 or
5 south
2 or
4 east
2 or
9 whichever
2 it
2 is
2 we
6 couldn
1 t
4 hear
4 them
4 here
5 becky
4 grew
12 apprehensive
1 i
6 wonder
3 how
4 long
2 we
2 ve
4 been
4 down
4 here
3 tom
2 we
6 better
5 start
4 back
3 yes
1 i
6 reckon
2 we
6 better
1 p
4 raps
2 we
6 better
3 can
3 you
4 find
3 the
3 way
3 tom
2 it
1 s
3 all
1 a
5 mixed
2 up
11 crookedness
2 to
2 me
1 i
6 reckon
1 i
5 could
4 find
2 it
3 but
4 then
3 the
4 bats
2 if
4 they
3 put
3 our
7 candles
3 out
2 it
4 will
2 be
2 an
5 awful
3 fix
3 let
1 s
3 try
4 some
5 other
3 way
2 so
2 as
3 not
2 to
2 go
7 through
5 there
4 well
3 but
1 i
4 hope
2 we
3 won
1 t
3 get
4 lost
2 it
5 would
2 be
2 so
5 awful
3 and
3 the
4 girl
9 shuddered
2 at
3 the
7 thought
2 of
3 the
8 dreadful
13 possibilities
4 they
7 started
7 through
1 a
8 corridor
3 and
9 traversed
2 it
2 in
7 silence
1 a
4 long
3 way
8 glancing
2 at
4 each
3 new
7 opening
2 to
3 see
2 if
5 there
3 was
8 anything
8 familiar
5 about
3 the
4 look
2 of
2 it
3 but
4 they
4 were
3 all
7 strange
5 every
4 time
3 tom
4 made
2 an
11 examination
5 becky
5 would
5 watch
3 his
4 face
3 for
2 an
11 encouraging
4 sign
3 and
2 he
5 would
3 say
8 cheerily
2 oh
2 it
1 s
3 all
5 right
4 this
3 ain
1 t
3 the
3 one
3 but
2 we
2 ll
4 come
2 to
2 it
5 right
4 away
3 but
2 he
4 felt
4 less
3 and
4 less
7 hopeful
4 with
4 each
7 failure
3 and
9 presently
5 began
2 to
4 turn
3 off
4 into
9 diverging
7 avenues
2 at
5 sheer
6 random
2 in
9 desperate
4 hope
2 of
7 finding
3 the
3 one
4 that
3 was
6 wanted
2 he
5 still
4 said
2 it
3 was
3 all
5 right
3 but
5 there
3 was
4 such
1 a
6 leaden
5 dread
2 at
3 his
5 heart
4 that
3 the
5 words
3 had
4 lost
5 their
4 ring
3 and
7 sounded
4 just
2 as
2 if
2 he
3 had
4 said
3 all
2 is
4 lost
5 becky
5 clung
2 to
3 his
4 side
2 in
2 an
7 anguish
2 of
4 fear
3 and
5 tried
4 hard
2 to
4 keep
4 back
3 the
5 tears
3 but
4 they
5 would
4 come
2 at
4 last
3 she
4 said
2 oh
3 tom
5 never
4 mind
3 the
4 bats
3 let
1 s
2 go
4 back
4 that
3 way
2 we
4 seem
2 to
3 get
5 worse
3 and
5 worse
3 off
3 all
3 the
4 time
6 listen
4 said
2 he
8 profound
7 silence
7 silence
2 so
4 deep
4 that
4 even
5 their
10 breathings
4 were
11 conspicuous
2 in
3 the
4 hush
3 tom
7 shouted
3 the
4 call
4 went
7 echoing
4 down
3 the
5 empty
6 aisles
3 and
4 died
3 out
2 in
3 the
8 distance
2 in
1 a
5 faint
5 sound
4 that
9 resembled
1 a
6 ripple
2 of
7 mocking
8 laughter
2 oh
3 don
1 t
2 do
2 it
5 again
3 tom
2 it
2 is
3 too
6 horrid
4 said
5 becky
2 it
2 is
6 horrid
3 but
1 i
6 better
5 becky
4 they
5 might
4 hear
2 us
3 you
4 know
3 and
2 he
7 shouted
5 again
3 the
5 might
3 was
4 even
1 a
8 chillier
6 horror
4 than
3 the
7 ghostly
8 laughter
2 it
2 so
9 confessed
1 a
9 perishing
4 hope
3 the
8 children
5 stood
5 still
3 and
8 listened
3 but
5 there
3 was
2 no
6 result
3 tom
6 turned
4 upon
3 the
4 back
5 track
2 at
4 once
3 and
7 hurried
3 his
5 steps
2 it
3 was
3 but
1 a
6 little
5 while
6 before
1 a
7 certain
10 indecision
2 in
3 his
6 manner
8 revealed
7 another
7 fearful
4 fact
2 to
5 becky
2 he
5 could
3 not
4 find
3 his
3 way
4 back
2 oh
3 tom
3 you
4 didn
1 t
4 make
3 any
5 marks
5 becky
1 i
3 was
4 such
1 a
4 fool
4 such
1 a
4 fool
1 i
5 never
7 thought
2 we
5 might
4 want
2 to
4 come
4 back
2 no
1 i
3 can
1 t
4 find
3 the
3 way
2 it
1 s
3 all
5 mixed
2 up
3 tom
3 tom
2 we
2 re
4 lost
2 we
2 re
4 lost
2 we
5 never
3 can
3 get
3 out
2 of
4 this
5 awful
5 place
2 oh
3 why
3 did
2 we
4 ever
5 leave
3 the
6 others
3 she
4 sank
2 to
3 the
6 ground
3 and
5 burst
4 into
4 such
1 a
6 frenzy
2 of
6 crying
4 that
3 tom
3 was
8 appalled
4 with
3 the
4 idea
4 that
3 she
5 might
3 die
2 or
4 lose
3 her
6 reason
2 he
3 sat
4 down
2 by
3 her
3 and
3 put
3 his
4 arms
6 around
3 her
3 she
6 buried
3 her
4 face
2 in
3 his
5 bosom
3 she
5 clung
2 to
3 him
3 she
6 poured
3 out
3 her
7 terrors
3 her
10 unavailing
7 regrets
3 and
3 the
3 far
6 echoes
6 turned
4 them
3 all
2 to
7 jeering
8 laughter
3 tom
6 begged
3 her
2 to
5 pluck
2 up
4 hope
5 again
3 and
3 she
4 said
3 she
5 could
3 not
2 he
4 fell
2 to
7 blaming
3 and
7 abusing
7 himself
3 for
7 getting
3 her
4 into
4 this
9 miserable
9 situation
4 this
3 had
1 a
6 better
6 effect
3 she
4 said
3 she
5 would
3 try
2 to
4 hope
5 again
3 she
5 would
3 get
2 up
3 and
6 follow
8 wherever
2 he
5 might
4 lead
2 if
4 only
2 he
5 would
3 not
4 talk
4 like
4 that
3 any
4 more
3 for
2 he
3 was
2 no
4 more
2 to
5 blame
4 than
3 she
3 she
4 said
2 so
4 they
5 moved
2 on
5 again
9 aimlessly
6 simply
2 at
6 random
3 all
4 they
5 could
2 do
3 was
2 to
4 move
4 keep
6 moving
3 for
1 a
6 little
5 while
4 hope
4 made
1 a
4 show
2 of
8 reviving
3 not
4 with
3 any
6 reason
2 to
4 back
2 it
3 but
4 only
7 because
2 it
2 is
3 its
6 nature
2 to
6 revive
4 when
3 the
6 spring
3 has
3 not
4 been
5 taken
3 out
2 of
2 it
2 by
3 age
3 and
11 familiarity
4 with
7 failure
2 by
3 and
2 by
3 tom
4 took
5 becky
1 s
6 candle
3 and
4 blew
2 it
3 out
4 this
7 economy
5 meant
2 so
4 much
5 words
4 were
3 not
6 needed
5 becky
10 understood
3 and
3 her
4 hope
4 died
5 again
3 she
4 knew
4 that
3 tom
3 had
1 a
5 whole
6 candle
3 and
5 three
2 or
4 four
6 pieces
2 in
3 his
7 pockets
3 yet
2 he
4 must
9 economize
2 by
3 and
2 by
7 fatigue
5 began
2 to
6 assert
3 its
6 claims
3 the
8 children
5 tried
2 to
3 pay
9 attention
3 for
2 it
3 was
8 dreadful
2 to
5 think
2 of
7 sitting
4 down
4 when
4 time
3 was
5 grown
2 to
2 be
2 so
8 precious
6 moving
2 in
4 some
9 direction
2 in
3 any
9 direction
3 was
2 at
5 least
8 progress
3 and
5 might
4 bear
5 fruit
3 but
2 to
3 sit
4 down
3 was
2 to
6 invite
5 death
3 and
7 shorten
3 its
7 pursuit
2 at
4 last
5 becky
1 s
5 frail
5 limbs
7 refused
2 to
5 carry
3 her
7 farther
3 she
3 sat
4 down
3 tom
6 rested
4 with
3 her
3 and
4 they
6 talked
2 of
4 home
3 and
3 the
7 friends
5 there
3 and
3 the
11 comfortable
4 beds
3 and
5 above
3 all
3 the
5 light
5 becky
5 cried
3 and
3 tom
5 tried
2 to
5 think
2 of
4 some
3 way
2 of
10 comforting
3 her
3 but
3 all
3 his
14 encouragements
4 were
5 grown
10 threadbare
4 with
3 use
3 and
7 sounded
4 like
8 sarcasms
7 fatigue
4 bore
2 so
7 heavily
4 upon
5 becky
4 that
3 she
7 drowsed
3 off
2 to
5 sleep
3 tom
3 was
8 grateful
2 he
3 sat
7 looking
4 into
3 her
5 drawn
4 face
3 and
3 saw
2 it
4 grow
6 smooth
3 and
7 natural
5 under
3 the
9 influence
2 of
8 pleasant
6 dreams
3 and
2 by
3 and
2 by
1 a
5 smile
6 dawned
3 and
6 rested
5 there
3 the
8 peaceful
4 face
9 reflected
8 somewhat
2 of
5 peace
3 and
7 healing
4 into
3 his
3 own
6 spirit
3 and
3 his
8 thoughts
8 wandered
4 away
2 to
6 bygone
5 times
3 and
6 dreamy
8 memories
5 while
2 he
3 was
4 deep
2 in
3 his
7 musings
5 becky
4 woke
2 up
4 with
1 a
6 breezy
6 little
5 laugh
3 but
2 it
3 was
8 stricken
4 dead
4 upon
3 her
4 lips
3 and
1 a
5 groan
8 followed
2 it
2 oh
3 how
5 could
1 i
5 sleep
1 i
4 wish
1 i
5 never
5 never

4 they
4 rose
2 up
3 and
8 wandered
5 along
4 hand
2 in
4 hand
3 and
8 hopeless
4 they
5 tried
2 to
8 estimate
3 how
4 long
4 they
3 had
4 been
2 in
3 the
4 cave
3 but
3 all
4 they
4 knew
3 was
4 that
2 it
6 seemed
4 days
3 and
5 weeks
3 and
3 yet
2 it
3 was
5 plain
4 that
4 this
5 could
3 not
2 be
3 for
5 their
7 candles
4 were
3 not
4 gone
3 yet
1 a
4 long
4 time
5 after
4 this
4 they
5 could
3 not
4 tell
3 how
4 long
3 tom
4 said
4 they
4 must
2 go
6 softly
3 and
6 listen
3 for
8 dripping
5 water
4 they
4 must
4 find
1 a
6 spring
4 they
5 found
3 one
9 presently
3 and
3 tom
4 said
2 it
3 was
4 time
2 to
4 rest
5 again
4 both
4 were
7 cruelly
5 tired
3 yet
5 becky
4 said
3 she
7 thought
3 she
5 could
2 go
1 a
6 little
7 farther
3 she
3 was
9 surprised
2 to
4 hear
3 tom
7 dissent
3 she

10 frightened
4 look
2 in
5 becky
1 s
4 face
7 brought
3 tom
2 to
3 his

3 and
2 he
3 saw

3 had
4 made
1 a
7 blunder
5 becky
3 was
3 not
2 to
4 have
4 gone
4 home
4 that
5 night
3 the
8 children
6 became
6 silent
3 and
10 thoughtful
2 in
1 a
6 moment
1 a
3 new
5 burst
2 of
5 grief
4 from
5 becky
6 showed
3 tom
4 that
3 the
5 thing
2 in
3 his
4 mind
3 had
6 struck
4 hers
4 also
4 that
3 the
7 sabbath
7 morning
5 might
2 be
4 half
5 spent
6 before
3 mrs
8 thatcher
10 discovered
4 that
5 becky
3 was
3 not
2 at
3 mrs
6 harper
1 s
3 the
8 children
8 fastened
5 their
4 eyes
4 upon
5 their
3 bit
2 of
6 candle
3 and
7 watched
2 it
4 melt
6 slowly
3 and
10 pitilessly
4 away
3 saw
3 the
4 half
4 inch
2 of
4 wick
5 stand
5 alone
2 at
4 last
3 saw
3 the
6 feeble
5 flame
4 rise
3 and
4 fall
5 climb
3 the
4 thin
6 column
2 of
5 smoke
6 linger
2 at
3 its
3 top
1 a
6 moment
3 and
4 then
3 the
6 horror
2 of
5 utter
8 darkness
7 reigned
3 how
4 long
9 afterward
2 it
3 was
4 that
5 becky
4 came
2 to
1 a
4 slow
13 consciousness
4 that
3 she
3 was
6 crying
2 in
3 tom
1 s
4 arms
7 neither
5 could
4 tell
3 all
4 that
4 they
4 knew
3 was
4 that
5 after
4 what
6 seemed
1 a
6 mighty
7 stretch
2 of
4 time
4 both
5 awoke
3 out
2 of
1 a
4 dead
6 stupor
2 of
5 sleep
3 and
7 resumed
5 their
8 miseries
4 once
4 more
3 tom
4 said
2 it
5 might
2 be
6 sunday
3 now
5 maybe
6 monday
2 he
5 tried
2 to
3 get
5 becky
2 to
4 talk
3 but
3 her
7 sorrows
4 were
3 too
10 oppressive
3 all
3 her
5 hopes
4 were
4 gone
3 tom
4 said
4 that
4 they
4 must
4 have
4 been
6 missed
4 long
3 ago
3 and
2 no
5 doubt
3 the
6 search
3 was
5 going
2 on
2 he
5 would
5 shout
3 and
5 maybe
4 some
3 one
5 would
4 come
2 he
5 tried
2 it
3 but
2 in
3 the
8 darkness
3 the
7 distant
6 echoes
7 sounded
2 so
9 hideously
4 that
2 he
5 tried
2 it
2 no
4 more
3 the
5 hours
6 wasted
4 away
3 and
6 hunger
4 came
2 to
7 torment
3 the
8 captives
5 again
1 a
7 portion
2 of
3 tom
1 s
4 half
2 of
3 the
4 cake
3 was
4 left
4 they
7 divided
3 and
3 ate
2 it
3 but
4 they
6 seemed
8 hungrier
4 than
6 before
3 the
4 poor
6 morsel
2 of
4 food
4 only
7 whetted
6 desire
2 by
3 and
2 by
3 tom
4 said
2 sh
3 did
3 you
4 hear
4 that
4 both
4 held
5 their
6 breath
3 and
8 listened
5 there
3 was
1 a
5 sound
4 like
3 the
8 faintest
3 far
3 off
5 shout
9 instantly
3 tom
8 answered
2 it
3 and
7 leading
5 becky
2 by
3 the
4 hand
7 started
7 groping
4 down
3 the
8 corridor
2 in
3 its
9 direction
9 presently
2 he
8 listened
5 again
5 again
3 the
5 sound
3 was
5 heard
3 and
10 apparently
1 a
6 little
6 nearer
2 it
1 s
4 them
4 said
3 tom
4 they
2 re
6 coming
4 come
5 along
5 becky
2 we
2 re
3 all
5 right
3 now
3 the
3 joy
2 of
3 the
9 prisoners
3 was
6 almost
12 overwhelming
5 their
5 speed
3 was
4 slow
7 however
7 because
8 pitfalls
4 were
8 somewhat
6 common
3 and
3 had
2 to
2 be
7 guarded
7 against
4 they
7 shortly
4 came
2 to
3 one
3 and
3 had
2 to
4 stop
2 it
5 might
2 be
5 three
4 feet
4 deep
2 it
5 might
2 be
1 a
7 hundred
5 there
3 was
2 no
7 passing
2 it
2 at
3 any
4 rate
3 tom
3 got
4 down
2 on
3 his
6 breast
3 and
7 reached
2 as
3 far
4 down
2 as
2 he
5 could
2 no
6 bottom
4 they
4 must
4 stay
5 there
3 and
4 wait
5 until
3 the
9 searchers
4 came
4 they
8 listened
9 evidently
3 the
7 distant
9 shoutings
4 were
7 growing
4 more
7 distant
1 a
6 moment
2 or
3 two
4 more
3 and
4 they
3 had
4 gone
10 altogether
3 the
5 heart
7 sinking
6 misery
2 of
2 it
3 tom
7 whooped
5 until
2 he
3 was
6 hoarse
3 but
2 it
3 was
2 of
2 no
3 use
2 he
6 talked
9 hopefully
2 to
5 becky
3 but
2 an
3 age
2 of
7 anxious
7 waiting
6 passed
3 and
2 no
6 sounds
4 came
5 again
3 the
8 children
6 groped
5 their
3 way
4 back
2 to
3 the
6 spring
3 the
5 weary
4 time
7 dragged
2 on
4 they
5 slept
5 again
3 and
5 awoke
8 famished
3 and
3 woe
8 stricken
3 tom
8 believed
2 it
4 must
2 be
7 tuesday
2 by
4 this
4 time
3 now
2 an
4 idea
6 struck
3 him
5 there
4 were
4 some
4 side
8 passages
4 near
2 at
4 hand
2 it
5 would
2 be
6 better
2 to
7 explore
4 some
2 of
5 these
4 than
4 bear
3 the
6 weight
2 of
3 the
5 heavy
4 time
2 in
8 idleness
2 he
4 took
1 a
4 kite
4 line
4 from
3 his
6 pocket
4 tied
2 it
2 to
1 a
10 projection
3 and
2 he
3 and
5 becky
7 started
3 tom
2 in
3 the
4 lead
9 unwinding
3 the
4 line
2 as
2 he
6 groped
5 along
2 at
3 the
3 end
2 of
6 twenty
5 steps
3 the
8 corridor
5 ended
2 in
1 a
7 jumping
3 off
5 place
3 tom
3 got
4 down
2 on
3 his
5 knees
3 and
4 felt
5 below
3 and
4 then
2 as
3 far
6 around
3 the
6 corner
2 as
2 he
5 could
5 reach
4 with
3 his
5 hands
12 conveniently
2 he
4 made
2 an
6 effort
2 to
7 stretch
3 yet
1 a
6 little
7 farther
2 to
3 the
5 right
3 and
2 at
4 that
6 moment
3 not
6 twenty
5 yards
4 away
1 a
5 human
4 hand
7 holding
1 a
6 candle
8 appeared
4 from
6 behind
1 a
4 rock
3 tom
6 lifted
2 up
1 a
8 glorious
5 shout
3 and
9 instantly
4 that
4 hand
3 was
8 followed
2 by
3 the
4 body
2 it
8 belonged
2 to
5 injun
3 joe
1 s
3 tom
3 was
9 paralyzed
2 he
5 could
3 not
4 move
2 he
3 was
6 vastly
9 gratified
3 the
4 next
6 moment
2 to
3 see
3 the
8 spaniard
4 take
2 to
3 his
5 heels
3 and
3 get
7 himself
3 out
2 of
5 sight
3 tom
8 wondered
4 that
3 joe
3 had
3 not
10 recognized
3 his
5 voice
3 and
4 come
4 over
3 and
6 killed
3 him
3 for
10 testifying
2 in
5 court
3 but
3 the
6 echoes
4 must
4 have
9 disguised
3 the
5 voice
7 without
5 doubt
4 that
3 was
2 it
2 he
8 reasoned
3 tom
1 s
6 fright
8 weakened
5 every
6 muscle
2 in
3 his
4 body
2 he
4 said
2 to
7 himself
4 that
2 if
2 he
3 had
8 strength
6 enough
2 to
3 get
4 back
2 to
3 the
6 spring
2 he
5 would
4 stay
5 there
3 and
7 nothing
6 should
5 tempt
3 him
2 to
3 run
3 the
4 risk
2 of
7 meeting
5 injun
3 joe
5 again
2 he
3 was
7 careful
2 to
4 keep
4 from
5 becky
4 what
2 it
3 was
2 he
3 had
4 seen
2 he
4 told
3 her
2 he
3 had
4 only
7 shouted
3 for
4 luck
3 but
6 hunger
3 and
12 wretchedness
4 rise
8 superior
2 to
5 fears
2 in
3 the
4 long
3 run
7 another
7 tedious
4 wait
2 at
3 the
6 spring
3 and
7 another
4 long
5 sleep
7 brought
7 changes
3 the
8 children
5 awoke
8 tortured
4 with
1 a
6 raging
6 hunger
3 tom
8 believed
4 that
2 it
4 must
2 be
9 wednesday
2 or
8 thursday
2 or
4 even
6 friday
2 or
8 saturday
3 now
3 and
4 that
3 the
6 search
3 had
4 been
5 given
4 over
2 he
8 proposed
2 to
7 explore
7 another
7 passage
2 he
4 felt
7 willing
2 to
4 risk
5 injun
3 joe
3 and
3 all
5 other
7 terrors
3 but
5 becky
3 was
4 very
4 weak
3 she
3 had
4 sunk
4 into
1 a
6 dreary
6 apathy
3 and
5 would
3 not
2 be
6 roused
3 she
4 said
3 she
5 would
4 wait
3 now
5 where
3 she
3 was
3 and
3 die
2 it
5 would
3 not
2 be
4 long
3 she
4 told
3 tom
2 to
2 go
4 with
3 the
4 kite
4 line
3 and
7 explore
2 if
2 he
5 chose
3 but
3 she
8 implored
3 him
2 to
4 come
4 back
5 every
6 little
5 while
3 and
5 speak
2 to
3 her
3 and
3 she
4 made
3 him
7 promise
4 that
4 when
3 the
5 awful
4 time
4 came
2 he
5 would
4 stay
2 by
3 her
3 and
4 hold
3 her
4 hand
5 until
3 all
3 was
4 over
3 tom
6 kissed
3 her
4 with
1 a
7 choking
9 sensation
2 in
3 his
6 throat
3 and
4 made
1 a
4 show
2 of
5 being
9 confident
2 of
7 finding
3 the
9 searchers
2 or
2 an
6 escape
4 from
3 the
4 cave
4 then
2 he
4 took
3 the
4 kite
4 line
2 in
3 his
4 hand
3 and
4 went
7 groping
4 down
3 one
2 of
3 the
8 passages
2 on
3 his
5 hands
3 and
5 knees
10 distressed
4 with

1 a

2 of
1 a

2 it
4 must
4 stop
4 here
3 the

2 go
4 much
7 further

3 the

5 again
3 and
3 see
